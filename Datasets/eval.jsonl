The waiver by any          party of any right arising out of any breach by the other party shall          not be construed as a waiver of any right arising out of a subsequent          breach.\n\n                  11.4.

PURCHASE ORDERS AND STOCK ON HAND\n\n1. Issuance and Acceptance of Purchase Order. To order the Xplore Products, Distributor shall place a purchase order via sending an email to xpldistributors@zebra.com. Each purchase order shall specify the bill-to address, ship-to address, quantity and description of each Xplore Product ordered, the unit price for each Xplore Product, the requested ship date, the preferred means of delivery, and tax-exempt certifications, if any. Orders received without this information or which contain any discrepancy may be returned to Distributor for completion or revision as applicable. Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect. Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore's acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall confirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Xplore reserves the right where necessary to amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date, and may at its sole discretion require an amended Order from Distributor incorporating such changes. For the purposes of this Exhibit B, \"Estimated Shipping Date\" shall mean the estimated shipping date of an accepted purchase order.\n\n2. Purchase Order Rescheduling, Cancellation and Modification. Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.\n\nCertain purchase orders, determined at Xplore's sole discretion, and generally of large volume and/or extended lead times, may be subject to alternative rescheduling, cancellation, and modification rights. Should such purchase orders be subject to alternative rights, Xplore shall inform Distributor of alternative rights prior to order acceptance. Distributor will then have [*****] business days to accept, or reject, the alternative terms of Xplore for that certain purchase order. If Distributor rejects such alternative terms, the purchase order will not be accepted by Xplore.\n\n3. Product Allocation. If for any reason, Xplore's production is not on schedule, Xplore may, at its sole and absolute discretion, allocate available inventory to Distributor and make shipments in accordance with Zebra's then current processes.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Stock on Hand. Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor's inventory to support sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.\n\n5. Product Return and Stock Rotation. The terms of Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement will apply to Xplore Products, provided however that stock rotation allowance for Xplore Products will be based on the net dollar value of Distributor's purchases in each calendar quarter of Xplore Products and such allowance will be calculated separate and apart from all other Products purchased by Distributor during such period.\n\nARTICLE II. DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS\n\n1. Shipping Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010, whereby Distributor's price, includes all costs of delivery, insurance, import and / or export duties and tariffs. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents. [*****]\n\n1. At Distributor's request, Xplore may deliver Xplore Products directly to Program Members or their respective End Users on behalf of Distributor, and in such instances title and risk of loss will pass to Distributor upon delivery to the applicable recipients, as indicated on the PoD documents. Some exclusions may apply, including countries not served by Xplore shipping and importing methods, and/or countries where Xplore Products, are not certified for resale and/or use.\n\n1. Proof of Delivery (\"POD\"). Xplore shall provide to Distributor, at no charge, a means for confirming proof of delivery for Xplore Product shipments when requested by Distributor. Xplore shall provide packing slips for all shipments.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019"

The Company's internal control over  financial reporting is effective and the Company is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Since the  date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, there has  been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Such disclosure controls and procedures (a) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that  material information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial  Officer by others within those entities. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance.\n\n(v) The Company and each of its subsidiaries maintains insurance covering their properties, personnel and business. Such insurance insures  against such losses and risks as are adequate in accordance with the Company's perception of customary industry practice to protect the  Company and its subsidiaries and their businesses. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have received notice from any insurer or agent  of such insurer that substantial capital improvements or other expenditures will have to be made in order to continue such insurance. All such  insurance is outstanding and duly in force on the date hereof and will be outstanding and duly in force on the Commencement Date and the  Remarketing Settlement Date.\n\n(w) Neither the Company nor any agent thereof acting on the behalf of the Company has taken, and none of them will take, any action that might  cause the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the Trust of the Transaction Agreements, as applicable, the issuance of the  Unit Securities by the Company and the Trust, as applicable, the Remarketing of the Remarketing Securities by the Company and the Trust, as  applicable, and the consummation by the Company and the Trust, as applicable, of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to violate  Regulation T (12 C.F.R. Part 220), Regulation U (12 C.F.R. Part 221) or Regulation X (12 C.F.R.

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, its officers and  employees and each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss,  claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action  relating to purchases and sales of the Remarketing Securities), to which the Remarketing Agent or that officer, employee or controlling person may  become subject, under\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:\n\n(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any (A) the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale  Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the  Securities Act, the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) any blue sky application or other document prepared or  executed by the Company or the Trust (or based upon any written information furnished by the Company or the Trust) filed in any  jurisdiction specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Remarketing Securities under the securities laws of any state or other  jurisdiction (such application, document or information being hereinafter called a \"Blue Sky Application\");\n\n(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the  Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, the Prospectus or in any  amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements therein (and with respect to the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such issuer free writing prospectus, in the light of  the circumstances under which such statements are made) not misleading; and\n\n(iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by the Remarketing Agent in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the  Remarketing, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters  covered by clause (i) or (ii) above, provided that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a  final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or  failure to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by the Remarketing Agent through its gross negligence or willful misconduct;\n\nand shall reimburse the Remarketing Agent and each such officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other  expenses reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent or that officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or  defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that  the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon,  any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement,  the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 (d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with the written  information concerning the Remarketing Agent furnished to the Issuers through the Representatives by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent  expressly for inclusion therein (which consists of the\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninformation specified in Section 2(c)). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to  the Remarketing Agent or to any officer, employee or controlling person of the Remarketing Agent.\n\n(b) The Remarketing Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, and employees and each of its directors, the Trust and  each Trustee and each person, if any, who controls any of the Issuers within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim,  damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any  such Trustee or any such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage,  liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:\n\n(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus,  any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities  Act, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application; or\n\n(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the  Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or Prospectus or in any  amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements therein (and with respect to the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such free writing prospectus, in the light of the  circumstances under which such statements are made) not misleading;\n\nbut in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance  upon and in conformity with the written information furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent specifically for inclusion  therein (which consists of the information specified in Section 2(c)), and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or employee,  the Trust or any such Trustee or such controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the  Company or any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any Trustee or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or  defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity  agreement is in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer or  employee, the Trust or any such Trustee or any such controlling person.\n\n(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified  party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing  of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any  liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the  failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action shall be  brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate  therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel  satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of  such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided  however, the Remarketing Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers,  employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the  Remarketing Agent against the Company under this Section 7 if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Remarketing Agent it is advisable  for the Remarketing Agent, its officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, due to the availability of  one or more legal defenses to them which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, and in that event the  reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable for  the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) at any time for all  such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall:\n\n(i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or  consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim  or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising  out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or\n\n(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to  indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.\n\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party  under Section 7(a), 7(b) or 7(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, other than to  the extent that such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient due to a failure to provide prompt notice in accordance with Section 7(c), then  each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party  as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof:\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing  Agent on the other hand from the Remarketing; or\n\n(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the  other with respect to the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or  liability (or action in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.\n\nThe relative benefits received by the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be  deemed to be in the same proportion as the aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities as of the end of day on the day next preceding  the Remarketing Settlement Date less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4(a) and less the expenses paid by the Company  pursuant to Section 4(b), on the one hand, and the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to such Section 4(a), plus the expenses  paid by the Company pursuant to Section 4(b), on the other hand, bear to such aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities. The  relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission  to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand, the intent of the  parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and  the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be  determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to  herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to  above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), the  Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total price at which Remarketing Securities distributed in the  Remarketing exceed the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue  or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)  of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\nSection 8. [Reserved]\n\nSection 9. Dealing in the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other  capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent may to the  extent permitted by law exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketing Securities\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmay be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Trust Agreement or the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.  The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may, to the extent permitted by law, also engage in or have an  interest in any financial or other transaction with the Issuers as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\nSection 10. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by  the express provisions of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the  Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the  Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the  requirements of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The  Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or  made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder  of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a  Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its  part. The Remarketing Agent will be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination by the Calculation Agent under the Calculation Agency  Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 between the Company and Reinsel & Company LLP, as Calculation Agent, of the Accreted Value or  Discount relating to the Preferred Securities and Debentures, as applicable, and will incur no liability to the Company or any holder of Remarketing  Securities relating to inaccuracies in calculating such Accreted Value or Discount.\n\nSection 11. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate (i) the Business Day immediately following the Remarketing Settlement Date, (ii) at 5:00  p.m., New York City time, on the last date of the Remarketing if the Remarketing is not successful or (iii) on the effective date of the resignation or  removal of the Remarketing Agent and the appointment of a new Remarketing Agent. In addition, the obligations of the Remarketing Agent  hereunder may be terminated by it by notice given to the Company prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date immediately preceding the  Commencement Date if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 6(i), (j) or (k) shall have occurred.\n\nIf this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any  liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that:\n\n(x) if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms  or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it; and\n\n(y) if the Remarketing Agent failed or refused to perform its obligations hereunder, without some reason sufficient hereunder to justify the  cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder, the Remarketing Agent shall not be relieved of liability to the Company for damages  occasioned by its default and shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for any expense.\n\nSection 12.

Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by a party hereto, the other party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY], without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security.\n\n      10.5.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby appoints the Agent, and the Agent hereby accepts appointment, as an authorized distributor agent within the Territory, (Territory as outlined in section 1.2), for the promotion, sale and collection of payment for, the Products to Customers. The Company has appointed a limited number of Agents; however, the Company retains the right to itself, and/or appoint others to, promote, sell, and collect payment for, and distribute, the Products to Customers in the Territory.\n\n   1.2. Territory. The Territory is defined as that geographical area in which said Agent is represented by a full time field sales representative, and of which assigned Distributor agrees to be responsible for mutually agreed upon quarterly and annual sales objectives as described in the \"Business Plan\".

The Company and the Agent will negotiate the terms and conditions of each Business Plan in good faith, using their respective best efforts to agree upon such terms and conditions. The parties will review each then-current Business Plan quarterly and update such Business Plan from time to time as may be mutually agreed upon in writing.

Product(s) shipped to the Customer will be billed to the Agent       at the price stated on a current price list or according to the current       price program minus a ten (10) percent discount as outlined in Paragraph       1.5(d). It is the responsibility of the Agent to evaluate the credit       worthiness of the Customer. Upon transmitting an order for shipment to the       Company, the Agent accepts full responsibility for payment of the product       from the Customer.\n\n         (m) transmit all orders, taken from the Customer for Product(s), a       minimum of once daily basis, by either fax, electronic mail, or other       agreed upon means of transmission so as to afford the Company time to       process and ship said orders in an expediant manner.\n\n         (n) sell products only at the Company's current stated list or       promotional price.\n\n   1.5 Company Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, the Company will at its sole expense:\n\n         (a) use its reasonable best efforts to fill and ship all accepted       orders for Products received from the Agent on a daily basis so as to be       shipped no later than the next business day. Orders received on Fridays or       the day before holidays will not be shipped until the next business day       unless special arrangements have been made at the customers expense. The       Company will supply a list confirming such order shipments to the Agent by       the end of the next business day. If orders exceed the available inventory       levels, the Company will use reasonable efforts to inform the Agent and       ship the remaining inventory in a manner that the Company deems as being       fair and equitable. If product becomes available during a backorder, the       Company will ship orders on a first-come, first-serve basis, but can, at       its\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n                                    -5-\n\n   own discretion, give partial shipments to large orders. In no event will       the Company be obligated to provide Products to the Agent in excess of one       hundred and twenty percent (120%) of any maximum quantity specified in the       applicable Business Plan;\n\n         (b) provide to the Agent's field sales personnel at least four (4)       hours of initial Products sales and marketing training, and Agent       telesales personnel at least one (1) hour of initial Product sales and       marketing training, and such supplemental training, if any, as the Company       may deem appropriate, in each case, at such times and locations as may be       mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Agent.\n\n         (c) supply such literature, ad reprints and other promotional aids       and furnish Agent with other information that in the opinion of the       Company may be helpful in the sale of listed Product(s).\n\n         (d) compensate the Agent through a discount of eight (8) percent off       of the current price of the Product times the total monthly units shipped       at that price to the Customer in the Agent's Territory excluding any       taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company. The       Company will compensate the Agent an additional two (2) percent through a       discount off of the current price or promotional price of the Product       times the total monthly units shipped at that price to the Customer       excluding any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the       Company, so as to compensate the Agent's sales representatives. Therefore,       a total of ten (10) percent discount off of the current price list or       promotional price times the total monthly units shipped at that price to       the Customer will be applied as payment for services from the Agent       including, but not limited to, the promotion, sales, and collection of       payment from the Customer for Product shipped by the Company. In addition       the Company will compensate the Agent quarterly an additional two (2)       percent commission (incentive), exclusive of taxes, and /or shipping and       handling charges incurred by the Company, based upon the attainment of       mutually agreed upon quarterly goals. One (1) percent of this incentive is       additional compensation for the Agent, and one (1) percent is for       additional compensation of the Agency sales force. In the event the Agent       fails to achieve these goals during any given quarter yet is able to       achieve the overall annual goals, then the Agent will receive the       incentive commission for that quarter at the conclusion of the fiscal       year. These goals are outlined in exhibit B.\n\n         (e) will replace, any unit of Product to the Customer which has       outdated (provided the Product is not outdated more than ninety (90) days)       with equal Product.    7\n\n                                    -6-\n\n                      2.

Terms of payment by the Agent to the Company for Products shipped to the Customer will be net thirty (30) days from the date of statement unless the Agent chooses to pay the Company via electronic funds transfer in which case the terms of payment will be net forty-five (45) days. All payments will be made in United States Dollars without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for) any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any political, taxing or other authority.\n\n   2.4. Taxes. The Customer will bear all taxes and duties which may be levied with respect to the purchase of the Products by the Agent (excluding any taxes on the Company's income therefrom), and the Company will bear all taxes and duties which shall be levied upon any of the Products if incidental to the Company's production of such Product or any component thereof. The Company will supply the Agent with such reasonable and necessary documents as may be required to carry out these provisions.\n\n   2.5. Claims. Any claim for shortage in Product delivery must be made within ten (10) business days after the Customer's receipt of shipment.

All claims by the Customer and/or Agent under this Paragraph 2.6 must be submitted in accordance with the Company's published bulletins concerning such claims, as such bulletins may be amended by the Company from time to time and furnished to the Agent.\n\n   THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OTHER THAN THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH 2.6. ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS DO NOT CONSTITUTE WARRANTIES AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON BY THE AGENT.    9\n\n                                    -8-\n\n                               3. COVENANTS.\n\n   3.1. Purchaser Guarantees, Instructions.

If, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice of a Third       Party Claim the Indemnifying Party fails to undertake to so defend, the       Notifying Party will have the right, but not the obligation, to defend and       to compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) the       Third Party Claim for the account and at the risk and expense of the       Indemnifying Party subject to the Indemnifying Party's prior written       approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each       party will make available to the other, at the other's reasonable expense,       such information and assistance as    11\n\n                                   -10-\n\n   the other may reasonably request in connection with the defense of a Third       Party Claim.\n\n   3.6. Assistance with Claims. Subject to Paragraph 3.5 hereof, each party will, at the request and expense of the other, furnish such reasonable assistance as may be required to enable the other party to defend itself against third party claims threatened or filed in connection with the manufacture, distribution, sale or use of the Products.\n\n   3.7. Confidential Information and Publicity. From time to time during the term of this Agreement either party may disclose or make available to the other Confidential Information (as defined below) in connection with activities contemplated hereunder. Except as may be required by law or as may be reasonably necessary to enforce rights hereunder, each party agrees that during the term of this Agreement and thereafter (a) it will use Confidential Information belonging to the other solely for the purpose(s) of this Agreement and (b) it will not disclose Confidential Information belonging to the other to any third party (other than its employees and/or consultants reasonably requiring such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement who are bound by obligations of nondisclosure and limited use at least as stringent as those contained herein) without the express prior written consent of the disclosing party. Each party further agrees that except as reasonably necessary for performance hereunder or otherwise expressly required by law, it will not publicly announce or otherwise disclose any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, or as may be required by law or reasonably necessary to enforce rights hereunder, neither party will use the name of the other in any advertising, promotional or sales materials relating to the Products, in any press release, or in any other manner whatsoever without the express prior written consent of the other. Each party will promptly return to the other upon request any Confidential Information of the other party then in its possession or under its control. The provisions of this Paragraph 3.7 will survive the expiration or any termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means, with respect to either party, any and all information (including, but not limited to, financial data and information concerning products, customers and business operations) in any form belonging to such party except information which at the relevant time is (a) known to the public through no act or omission in violation of this Agreement, (b) furnished to the receiving party by a third party having the lawful right to do so, (c) known to the receiving party prior to disclosure hereunder (as established by written documentation thereof) or (d) independently developed by the receiving party without reference to the Confidential Information.    12\n\n                                   -11-\n\n                         4. TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n   4.1. Term. This Agreement will become effective as of the date first written above and will continue in effect thereafter until terminated pursuant to Paragraph 4.2 below.\n\n   4.2. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated as follows:\n\n         (a) In the event that either party fails in any material respect to       observe or perform any of its obligations under this Agreement (with       respect to the Agent, including but not limited to Agent performance       criteria set forth in each Business Plan), which failure is not remedied       within thirty (30) days (or, in the case of payments due, within five (5)       business days), after receipt of written notice from the other party       specifying such failure, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.\n\n         (b) In the event of any material change in the organization,       ownership, management or control of the business of the Agent, the Company       may, at its option, terminate this Agreement upon giving written notice of       termination to the Agent. The Agent will promptly advise the Company in       writing of any event described in this Paragraph 4.2(b).\n\n\n\n\n\n         (c) Either party may, at its option, terminate this Agreement       without cause, effective at any time after January 31, 1999, upon giving       at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of such termination to the       other party.\n\n         (d) If after exercise of good faith efforts, the parties fail to       timely agree upon a Business Plan for any Contract Year before the start       of such year (with respect to the Business Plan for Contract Year ending       October 31, 1999, at least thirty (30) days or on a mutually agreed upon       date after the Agent Launch Date), this Agreement may be terminated by       either party upon giving at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of       such termination to the other party.\n\n         (e) In the event of any publicity concerning the Agent which the       Company reasonably believes to have a material adverse affect upon the       status or reputation of the Agent and/or the Products, the Company may, at       its option, terminate this Agreement upon giving at least five (5) days       prior written notice of such termination to the Agent.\n\n         (f) In the event the Company terminates, sells or otherwise       transfers its veterinary products business in its entirety, the Company       may    13\n\n                                   -12-\n\n   terminate this Agreement upon giving at least ninety (90) days prior       written notice of such termination to the Agent.\n\n   4.3. Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason:\n\n         (a) the Agent will immediately discontinue making any       representations regarding its status as an agent for the Company and will       immediately cease conducting any activities with respect to the promotion,       sale or distribution of the Products;\n\n         (b) all amounts owed by either party to the other will become       immediately due and payable as indicated in section 2.3;\n\n         (c) any then unfulfilled Product orders hereunder may be completed       by the Company or transferred to another Agent in the Company's       discretion. Any termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to       the settlement of the rights created and obligations incurred hereunder       prior to the time of such termination. In no event will either party be       liable for special or consequential damages arising out of the breach or       the termination of this Agreement. The provisions of this Paragraph 4.3       and of Paragraphs 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 will survive the termination of this       Agreement.\n\n                             5. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   5.1. Notices. All notices and other communications between the parties given pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed to have been sufficiently given when delivered by personal service or sent by recognized overnight courier service, telecommunication or registered U.S. Mail to the recipient at the address indicated on the signature page hereof. All such communications will be deemed effective on the earlier of (a) actual receipt or (b) if sent by courier service, on the next business day following the date delivered to the courier service (the courier service's receipt being evidence of the date of such delivery), or (c) if sent by telecommunication on the next business date (subject to confirmation of receipt in complete readable form), or (d) if sent by registered U.S. Mail, five (5) business days after delivery to the U.S. Postal Service, postage prepaid. Either party may give to the other written notice of change of address, in which event any communication will thereafter be given to such party at such changed address.\n\n   5.2. Assignment. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.    14\n\n                                   -13-\n\nNeither party will not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other party.\n\n   5.3. Waivers. Any waiver by either party of any rights arising from a breach of any covenants or conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and will not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same nature or other covenants or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n   5.4. Relationship of Parties This Agreement is not intended to create, nor should it be construed as creating, a joint venture, partnership or similar relationship between the parties. The Agent will act solely as an independent agent and will have no right to bind the Company in any way or to represent that the Company is in any way responsible for any acts or omissions of the Agent.\n\n   5.5. Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if either the Company or the Agent is delayed in or prevented from fulfilling any of its obligations hereunder by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control (including, but not limited to acts of God, fire, third party strike,\n\n\n\n\n\nflood, delay of transportation or inability to obtain necessary raw materials through normal commercial channels), then that party will not be liable under this Agreement for damages resulting from such delay or failure. Each party will promptly notify the other upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any such cause and will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any resulting delay in or interference with the performance of its obligations hereunder.\n\n   5.6. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and all related business transactions will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (without reference to principles of conflicts or choice of law which would cause the application of the internal laws of any other jurisdiction). The courts of or in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will have nonexclusive jurisdiction over any disputes hereunder. Service of any action or proceeding in any such courts by either party may be made upon the other by registered mail, return receipt requested, at its address given herein.\n\n   5.7. Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be amended except by a writing duly signed on behalf of each party.\n\n   5.8. Remedies. All remedies available to either party for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately. The exercise of one remedy will not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.\n\n   5.9. Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement, in whole or in part, is invalid, unenforceable or in conflict with the applicable laws or    15\n\n                                   -14-\n\nregulations of any jurisdiction, such provision will be replaced, to the extent possible, with a provision which accomplishes the original business purposes of the provision in a valid and enforceable manner, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain unaffected and in full force provided, however, that if without such invalid or unenforceable provision the fundamental mutual objectives of the parties cannot be achieved, either party may terminate this Agreement without penalty by written notice to the other.\n\n   5.10. Interest. Any overdue amounts payable hereunder will bear interest, payable on demand (whether before or after judgment), from due date to date of payment, at an annual rate of two percent (2%) above the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the due date or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.\n\n   5.11. Miscellaneous. Each party will bear its own expenses in connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement. The headings of the paragraphs and subparagraphs of this Agreement have been added for the convenience of the parties and are not be deemed a part hereof.

If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are greater than the fees you actually owe us, we will credit the excess against the amount we otherwise would debit from your account for the next payment due.   4.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts   Any payment not actually received by us on or before the Fifteen (15 th ) day of each month (or the next business day if the Fifteen(15 th ) of any month is not a business day) shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay to us, in addition to the overdue payment, interest on such overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less.

OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION   Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights granted under this Agreement to you shall forthwith terminate and:   11.1 Cessation of Business   You shall immediately cease to operate the Franchised Business, and shall not thereafter, directly or indirectly, represent to the public or hold yourself out as a present or former master franchisee of ours.   11.2 Cessation of Use of Confidential Information and Proprietary Marks   You shall immediately and permanently cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner whatsoever, any confidential methods, procedures, and techniques associated with the System, and all Proprietary Marks and distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, and devices associated with the System.   11.3 Cancellation of Assumed Name Registration   You shall take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent registration obtained by you which contains the Proprietary Marks; and you shall furnish us with evidence satisfactory to us of compliance with this obligation within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.   11.4 Payment of Monies Due; Liquidated Damages   11.4.1 You shall promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates. In the event of termination for any default of yours, such sums shall include all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us as a result of the default, which obligation shall give rise to and remain, until paid in full, a lien in our favor against any and all leasehold improvements, fixtures, furnishings and equipment, inventory, supplies and vehicles located at or used in connection with the Franchised Business, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights. We shall have full power and authority to file such documents as are necessary to obtain and perfect such lien. We shall have the right to set off any amounts which we deem are payable to us by you.   11.4.2 In addition to the foregoing, upon termination of this Agreement by us for cause as described in Section 10, you agree to pay to us within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of this Agreement's termination, in addition to the amounts owed hereunder, liquidated damages equal to the average monthly Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee you paid during the twelve (12) months of operation preceding the effective date of termination multiplied by (a) twenty-four (24) (being the number of months in two (2) full years), or (b) the number of months remaining in the Agreement had it not been terminated, whichever is lower.   11.4.3 The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it would be impracticable to determine precisely the damages we would incur from this Agreement's termination and the loss of cash flow from Royalty Fees due to, among other things, the complications of determining what costs, if any, we might have saved and how much the Royalty Fees would have grown over what would have been this Agreement's remaining term. The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages.   11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.\n\n26\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.5 Costs to Secure Compliance   You shall pay to us all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us prior or subsequent to the termination or expiration of the franchise herein granted in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 11.   11.6 Return of Manuals and Other Confidential Information   You shall immediately deliver to us the Manuals and all other records, correspondence, files, and any instructions containing confidential information relating to the operation of the Franchised Business which are in your possession, and all copies thereof, all of which are acknowledged to be our property.   11.7 Irreparable Injury to Us   You agree and acknowledge that your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 11 will result in irreparable harm to us and to the Proprietary Marks, and you agree to pay all damages, expenses, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by us in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, and/or damages resulting from a violation of, the requirements of this Section 11.   11.8 Compliance with Post-Term Covenants   All of your covenants, obligations, and agreements which by their terms or by reasonable implication are to be performed, in whole or in part, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall survive such termination or expiration.   12. TRANSFER OF INTEREST   12.1 Transfer by Us   We shall have the right to assign this Agreement and all of our attendant rights and privileges to any person, firm, corporation or other entity provided that, with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of our functions: (i) the assignee shall, at the time of such assignment, be financially responsible and economically capable of performing our obligations; and (ii) the assignee shall expressly assume and agree to perform such obligations.

Accordingly, neither you nor any immediate or remote successor to any part of your interest in this Agreement, nor any individual, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity which directly or indirectly owns any interest in you shall not sell, encumber, assign, transfer, convey, pledge, merge, or give away any direct or indirect interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business. Any change in the control of you shall be deemed a transfer for purposes of this Agreement. Any purported assignment or transfer shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, for which we may immediately terminate without opportunity to cure pursuant to Section 10.2.3 of this Agreement.   12.3 Granting of a Security Interest by You   You shall not grant a security interest in the Franchised Business or in any of the assets of the Franchised Business without first obtaining our prior written consent. Our consent or refusal to consent may be based upon whatever factors we, in our sole discretion, deem economically and commercially reasonable in protecting our interests and security interest under this Agreement and the relationship created under this Agreement; however, if you are in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements between us or our affiliates and you, we shall, upon your written request, execute a written subordination of our security interest to lenders and/or lessors providing financing for the Franchised Business. Under any circumstances however, we shall not consent to any such granting of a security interest unless all of the following conditions are met:   12.3.1 Such security is granted only for the purpose of securing a loan in your favor, which loan shall only be for the benefit of the Franchised Business.   12.3.2 In the event of any default by you under any documents in any way relating to the security interest or the loan to which it relates, we shall have the right at our sole option (but not the obligation) to cure any such default and/or to be substituted as obligor to the lender whose interests are secured by such security interest.   12.3.3 In the event of any such default, and if we choose to be substituted as obligor, we shall be so substituted in all respects on the same terms and conditions to which you were subject, except that any acceleration of the obligations secured, due to your default, shall be void upon cure by us.   12.3.4 Such other conditions and terms as we shall deem necessary and/or prudent to protect our interests under this Agreement.   12.4 Transfer Upon Death or Disability   Upon the death or permanent disability (mental or physical) of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person shall transfer such interest to a third party approved by us within twelve (12) months after such death or disability. Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall be waived.

We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.\n\n31\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  15.

You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement, and any ancillary agreements executed contemporaneously herewith, as a result of your own independent investigation of the business franchised hereby and not as a result of any representation made by us or persons associated with us, or other franchisees, which are contrary to the terms herein set forth or which are contrary to the terms of any Franchise Disclosure Document or other similar document required or permitted to be given to you pursuant to applicable law. Except for those permitted under this Agreement to be made unilaterally by us, no amendment, change, or variation from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless mutually agreed to by the parties and executed by their authorized officers or agents in writing.

Warranties; Suspension, Termination\n\n      a.       Each party hereto warrants, represents, covenants and agrees                   that it has the right and power to enter into this Agreement,                   to grant the rights herein granted by it, and to perform the                   services agreed to be performed by it hereunder, and that no                   materials, ideas or other properties furnished or designated                   by it is subject to any restriction whatsoever, or is                   violative of the rights of any person, firm or corporation,                   including, without limitation, contract rights, copyrights and                   rights of privacy.\n\n      b.       If, because of an act of God, inevitable accident, fire,                   lockout, strike or other labor dispute, riot or civil                   commotion, act of public enemy, enactment, rule, order or act                   of any government or governmental instrumentality (whether                   federal, state, local or foreign), failure of technical                   facilities, failure or delay of transportation facilities,                   illness or incapacity of any performer or producer, or other                   cause of a similar or\n\n                                    6\n\n9\n\n               different nature not reasonably within either party's control,                   such party is materially hampered in the recording,                   manufacture, distribution or sale of phonograph records, or                   its normal business operations become commercially                   impractical, then without limiting its rights, it will have                   the option upon notice to suspend the Term of this Agreement                   for the duration of any such contingency. In the event of a                   suspension owing to a \"force majeure,\" which suspension                   exceeds six (6) consecutive months, the non-suspending party                   may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days written notice                   to other, but only if such \"force majeure\" does not affect a                   substantial portion of the United States recording industry or                   the suspension is not lifted by the suspending party within                   ten (10) days of the receipt of the written notice from the                   other party.\n\n10.      Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party          and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of          action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including          legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any          claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the          warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the          indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the          determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the          non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to          withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in          an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its          estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys'          fees) in connection therewith.\n\n11.      Notices. The respective addresses for each party for all purposes          hereunder are set forth on page 1 hereof, unless and until notice of a          different address is received by the party being notified of a change          of address. All notices will be in writing and will either be served by          personal delivery (to an officer of each company), by mail or by          telegraph, in each case with all charges prepaid. Notices will be          deemed effective when personally delivered, mailed certified mail or          similar delivery requiring a signature upon delivery, all charges          prepaid, except for notice of change of address, which will be          effective only when received by the party notified.

The failure to send courtesy copies of notices will not be          deemed a breach of this Agreement nor will it diminish the          effectiveness of such notice.\n\n12.      Assignment. Either party may, at its election, assign this Agreement or          any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in          whole or in part, to any person, firm or corporation owning or          acquiring all or a substantial portion of its assets, to any person,          firm or corporation that is related to it as an affiliate,\n\n                                    7\n\n10\n\n      subsidiary or otherwise, or to any person, firm or corporation into          which or with it might merge or consolidate.

All remedies,                   rights, undertakings, obligations, and agreements contained in                   this Agreement will be cumulative and none of them will be in                   limitation of any other remedy, right, undertaking, obligation                   or agreement of either party.

If any part of this Agreement will be determined to be invalid                   or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or by                   any other legally constituted body having jurisdiction to make                   such determination, the remainder of this Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.\n\n      d.

Licenses     3.1 Grant by SONY     SONY, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to PURCHASER a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free  license (a) under the Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, otherwise dispose of, and import any Competing Products  (including, without limitation, the SRAM Products); and (b) to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, perform, display, and otherwise  practice and exploit in any manner any and all of the SRAM Intellectual Property in connection with the use and exploitation of the      3\n\n\n\n\n\n     Transferred Assets, and to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, otherwise dispose of, and import Competing Products (including, without  limitation, SRAM Products).     3.2 Grant Back by PURCHASER     Subject to SONY's compliance with the covenant not to compete in Section 8.3 of Asset Purchase Agreement, PURCHASER  hereby grants to SONY a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license, under the Transferred Patents, to make, use, offer to sell,  sell, otherwise dispose of, and import any products, including any Competing Products. This Section 3.2 shall not be construed as superseding,  overriding or modifying Section 8.3 of Asset Purchase Agreement.     3.3 No Implied License or Other Assignment     Except as expressly set out in this IP Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement, neither party grants to the other Party, and  each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Party has not granted to it, any other license explicitly or implicitly under any Intellectual  Property nor has either party made any transfer or assignment to the other Party of any Intellectual Property or intellectual property rights.     3.4 No Sublicense Rights     No license granted by either party under this IP Agreement includes the right to grant sublicenses.     4. Each Party's Sole Right to the Intellectual Property     Each Party shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to apply for and register for protection for, prosecute, and maintain  any of its Intellectual Property and shall have the sole right to determine whether or not, and where, to apply for and/or register such protection, to  abandon attempts to obtain protection or abandon registered protection of any Intellectual Property, and/or to discontinue the maintenance of any  Intellectual Property without any obligation to inform the other Party of any such action or inaction. Neither Party is obligated to (a) file any patent  application or to secure any patent or patent rights, or (b) maintain any patent in force or prosecute any patent application.     4\n\n\n\n\n\n     5. Restrictions on Use of SONY Trademarks     5.1 No Trademark License     Both Parties agree and recognize that, except as specifically provided in this Section 5, SONY does not grant any trademark  license to PURCHASER under any SONY slogans, brands, trade names, monograms, logos, common law trademarks and service marks, trademark  and service mark registrations and applications or any World Wide Web addresses, sites and domain names or any variations thereof (\"SONY  Branding\"). PURCHASER agrees that, except as specifically provided in this Section 5, it shall not use any slogans, brands, trade names,  monograms, logos, common law trademarks and service marks, trademark and service mark registrations and applications or any World Wide Web  addresses, sites and domain names or any variations thereof (\"PURCHASER Branding\") that imitate or are confusingly similar to any SONY  Branding, nor shall it use PURCHASER Branding in commerce in a manner that would be confusingly similar to any SONY Branding.     5.2 Removal of SONY Trademarks     Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.5 or as otherwise agreed by SONY in writing, Purchaser shall either remove, cover  (i.e., sticker) or obliterate SONY Branding visible to the unaided human eye from all SRAM Products and product literature whether (a) transferred  in complete or incomplete form under the Asset Purchase Agreement, (b) manufactured under license under this IP Agreement, or (c) manufactured  using the Transferred Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PURCHASER shall have the right to sell finished SRAM Products bearing SONY  Branding acquired by PURCHASER under the Asset Purchase Agreement, subject to the provisions of Section 8.14 thereof.     5.3 Packaging     Except as expressly otherwise agreed by SONY in writing, all inventory of SRAM Products shall be packaged with labels clearly  indicating that it is a PURCHASER original product. PURCHASER is expressly prohibited from using any SONY Branding alone or on any SRAM  Product and/or product packaging. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PURCHASER shall have the right to sell finished SRAM Products bearing  SONY Branding      5\n\n\n\n\n\n     acquired by PURCHASER under the Asset Purchase Agreement, subject to the provisions of Section 8.14 thereof.     5.4 No Affiliation     PURCHASER shall not represent, imply, or connote in any way that it is affiliated with SONY or, other than as authorized by this  IP Agreement, use any SONY Trademark for any goods, parts, packaging of products, or services.     5.5 JTAG / Mask Works     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1, PURCHASER shall have the right to use any and all Mask Works transferred to  PURCHASER under the Asset Purchase Agreement, even if the use of such Mask Works results in a JTAG or other marking that would otherwise  indicate a connection to SONY, provided that:     (i) the use of such Masks is only for the manufacture by or for PURCHASER of SRAM Products that are qualified with  customers as of the Effective Date and updates or revisions of such SRAM Products that would not require requalification; and     (ii) PURCHASER allows SONY to audit PURCHASER's manufacture and testing of SRAM Products for purposes of  determining the quality of those SRAM Products that bear a marking which indicates a connection to SONY from time to time upon reasonable  request, subject to SONY's execution of a standard PURCHASER confidentiality agreement; and     (iii) no alterations are made to any such Mask in any way.     6. Payment     Consideration for the license granted by SONY under this IP Agreement is included in the Purchase Price, and PURCHASER  shall have no obligation to make any additional payments to SONY for the license granted under this Agreement.     6\n\n\n\n\n\n     7. Term and Termination     7.1 Term     Unless earlier terminated as provided below, this IP Agreement shall extend until the last date of expiration of the SRAM  Intellectual Property rights licensed under this IP Agreement.     7.2 Termination     (a) Should either Party fail to observe faithfully and materially perform each of the material obligations assumed by it in this IP  Agreement for thirty (30) days after its attention has been directed to any such breach by notice in writing from the other Party, the non-breaching  Party shall, at its option, have the right to terminate the license granted by it under this Agreement, such termination to be effected by serving  notice in writing upon the breaching Party to that effect on or after the expiration of such period of thirty (30) days.     (b) Should PURCHASER assert against SONY a claim based on its Patents and/or Intellectual Property, SONY shall, at its option,  have the right to terminate the license granted by SONY hereunder, such termination to be effected by serving notice in writing upon  PURCHASER to that effect not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination.     (c) Should SONY or any SONY Affiliate assert against PURCHASER a claim based on its Patents and/or Intellectual Property,  PURCHASER shall, at its option, have the right to terminate the license granted by PURCHASER hereunder, such termination to be effected by  serving notice in writing upon SONY to that effect not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination.     7.3 Insolvency     The licenses granted to a Party under Section 3 hereof shall automatically terminate should such Party become adjudicated  insolvent by reason of failure to pay its debts when due, enter into bankruptcy proceeding for its liquidation, voluntarily or involuntarily, or make  any assignment for the benefit of any one or more creditors.     7\n\n\n\n\n\n     7.4 Continuing Obligations     Termination of the licenses granted hereunder shall not affect any liability of either of the Parties previously accruing under this  IP Agreement.     8. Representations and Warranties     SONY hereby makes the following representations and warranties to PURCHASER, each of which shall be true and correct as of  the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, and shall be unaffected by any investigation heretofore or hereafter made:     8.1 Power and Authority     SONY has the right and power to enter into this IP Agreement and to transfer the Transferred Patents and to grant the license  set forth in Section 3.1.     8.2 Essential Patents     The Transferred Patents listed on Exhibit A comprise the Patents, both U.S. and foreign, owned or claimed by SONY or any  SONY Affiliate, that are essential to the conduct of the Business as conducted by SONY.     8.3 Ownership     All of the Transferred Patents are owned solely by SONY. No Transferred Patent is jointly owned by SONY and any other  Person, nor is it owned or jointly owned by any SONY Affiliate.     8.4 Validity and Enforceability     Each of the Transferred Patents (excluding applications) is subsisting, and, to the Knowledge of SONY, valid and in full force  and effect (except with respect to applications), and has not expired or been cancelled or abandoned. All necessary documents and certifications in  connection with each Transferred Patent (excluding applications) have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright or other authorities in the  United States and foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of avoiding abandonment, prosecuting and maintaining of      8\n\n\n\n\n\n     Transferred Patents (excluding applications). Except for actions of the relevant jurisdiction's patent and trademark office or other government  intellectual property office (\"Office Actions\"), SONY has not, to the Knowledge of SONY, received written notice of any pending or threatened  (and at no time within the two years prior to the Effective Date has there been pending any) action before any court, governmental authority or  arbitral tribunal in any jurisdiction challenging the use, ownership, validity, enforceability or registerability of any of the Transferred Patents.  Rejections of pending applications before a national patent, trademark or intellectual properly office will not constitute such written notice. Except  for Office Actions and broad Patent portfolio cross license agreements that SONY has signed with third parties (\"Portfolio Cross Licenses\"),  neither SONY nor any Affiliate of SONY is, to the Knowledge of SONY, a party to any settlements, covenants not to sue, consents, decrees,  stipulations, judgments or orders resulting from actions which permit third parties to use any Transferred Patents or any other SRAM Intellectual  Property included in the Transferred Assets. SONY has the sole right to enforce all of the Transferred Patents and the other SRAM Intellectual  Property rights of SONY included in the Transferred Assets.     8.5 Sufficiency     To the Knowledge of SONY, SONY and each of SONY's Affiliates owns, or has valid rights to use, all the SRAM Intellectual  Property material to the conduct of the Business, including, without limitation, the design, development, manufacture, marketing, use, distribution,  import, supply, provision and sale of SRAM Products.     8.6 Non-infringement by the Business     As of the Effective Date, SONY has not received written notice of any pending or threatened (and at no time within the two  years prior to the date of this Agreement has there been, to the Knowledge of SONY, pending any) action alleging that the activities or the  conduct of the Business dilutes (solely with respect to trademark rights), misappropriates, infringes, violates or constitutes the unauthorized use  of, or will dilute (solely with respect to trademark rights), misappropriate, infringe upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized use of the  Intellectual Property of any third party, nor, to the Knowledge of SONY, does there exist any basis therefor. Except for Office Actions pertaining to  the Transferred Patents and Patent licenses      9\n\n\n\n\n\n     granted by SONY under Portfolio Cross Licenses, neither SONY nor any of SONY's Affiliates is, to the Knowledge of SONY, party to any  settlement, covenant not to sue, consent, decree, stipulation, judgment, or order resulting from any action which (i) restricts SONY's or any of its  Affiliate's rights to use any SRAM Intellectual Property in connection with the Business, (ii) restricts the Business in order to accommodate a third  party's Intellectual Property rights or (iii) requires any future payment by SONY or any SONY Affiliate.     8.7 Infringement by a Third Party     To the Knowledge of SONY, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, or violating any SRAM Intellectual Property material  to the conduct of the Business that is owned by or exclusively licensed to SONY or any SONY Affiliate, and no Intellectual Property or other  proprietary right, misappropriation, infringement or violation actions have been brought against any third party by SONY or any SONY Affiliate in  connection with the Business.     8.8 Intellectual Property Development     To the knowledge of SONY:     (a) Each Person who is or has been employed by SONY or any Affiliate of SONY at any time at or prior to the date hereof in  connection with the development of any SRAM Intellectual Property or technology material to the Business, or is or has provided consulting  services to SONY or any Affiliate of SONY in connection with the development of any SRAM Intellectual Property or technology material to the  Business at any time at or prior to the Effective Date, has signed an agreement containing appropriate confidentiality terms.     (b) Except in the exercise of SONY's business judgment, other than under an appropriate confidentiality or nondisclosure  agreement or contractual provision relating to confidentiality and nondisclosure, there has been no disclosure to any third party of material  confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of SONY or any Affiliate of SONY related to any SRAM Product. All current and former  employees of SONY and each Affiliate of SONY who have made any material contributions to the development of any SRAM Product have signed  an invention assignment agreement that assigns ownership to SONY or have performed that work in the course, and within the scope, of their  employment.     10\n\n\n\n\n\n     (c) All consultants and independent contractors currently or previously engaged by SONY or its Affiliates who have made any  material contributions to the development of any SRAM Product (including, without limitation, all consultants and independent contractors who  have designed, written, or modified any firmware or software code contained in any SRAM Product) have entered into a work-made-for-hire  agreement or have otherwise assigned to SONY or a Affiliate of SONY (or a third party that previously conducted any business that forms any  part of the Business currently conducted by SONY and that has subsequently assigned its rights in such SRAM Product to SONY) all of their  right, title and interest (other than moral rights, if any) in and to the portions of such SRAM Product developed by them in the course of their work  for SONY or any Affiliate.     (d) Other than the employees, consultants and contractors referred to in this Section 8.8, no other Person has made or currently  is making any material contributions to the development of any SRAM Product.     8.9 Material Intellectual Property Agreements     Except for the SRAM Contracts assigned to and assumed by PURCHASER under the Asset Purchase Agreement and the  Portfolio Cross Licenses, there are no contracts, licenses or agreements between SONY or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any other  Person, on the other hand, with respect to any SRAM Intellectual Property material to the conduct of the Business, including any agreements with  respect to the manufacture or distribution of the SRAM Products.     8.10 Royalties     To the Knowledge of SONY, except for obligations under the SRAM Contracts assigned to and assumed by PURCHASER under  the Asset Purchase Agreement, neither SONY nor any Affiliate of SONY has any obligation to pay any third party any royalties or other fees for  the continued use of Intellectual Property which is specifically applicable to SRAM Products, and PURCHASER will not be obligated under any  contract or agreement to pay any royalties or other fees associated with SRAM Intellectual Property arising from the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.     11\n\n\n\n\n\n     8.11 No Loss of Rights     The consummation by SONY of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in any violation, loss or impairment of  ownership by SONY or any SONY Affiliate of, or impair or restrict the right of PURCHASER to use, any Transferred Patents or any other SRAM  Intellectual Property included in the Transferred Assets, and will not require the consent of any governmental authority or third party with respect  to any of Transferred Patents or any other SRAM Intellectual Property included in the Transferred Assets.     8.12 Transferability     All Transferred Patents will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by PURCHASER from and after the Closing without  restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party other than requirements under applicable laws to file documents with and pay fees  to patent offices. There are no Liens on any of the Transferred Patents. (For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that SONY's  licensees under Portfolio Cross Licenses already hold licenses to the Transferred Patents and do not need a license from PURCHASER to practice  the Transferred Patents.)     8.13 No SRAM Product Warranty Issues     To the Knowledge of SONY, each SRAM Product currently offered for sale by SONY (or its Affiliates, as the case may be)  conforms with all SONY datasheet specifications, except with respect to warranty claims made in the ordinary course of business. (For the  avoidance of doubt, epidemic failures or any substantial repeated failures of those products to comply with specifications that have not been  resolved are not in the ordinary course of business). SONY has not received written notice from any customer, reseller, OEM customer or  governmental authority alleging any such material non-conformance.     8.14 Disclaimer     NOTHING IN THIS IP AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY BY EITHER PARTY  OF THE VALIDITY OF ANY PATENT. NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO THE      12\n\n\n\n\n\n     OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF ANY INJURY, LOSS, OR DAMAGE, OF ANY KIND OR NATURE  SUSTAINED BY, OR ANY DAMAGE ASSESSED OR ASSERTED AGAINST, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY INCURRED BY OR IMPOSED UPON  THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RESULTING FROM (A) THE PRODUCTION,  USE, SALE, OFFER FOR SALE, OTHER DISPOSITIONS OR IMPORTATION OF ANY APPARATUS OR PRODUCT MADE BY THAT PARTY;  OR (B) ANY ADVERTISING OR OTHER PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES MADE BY THAT PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE  FOREGOING, AND EACH PARTY SHALL HOLD THE OTHER PARTY, AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES,  HARMLESS IN THE EVENT IT, OR ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES, IS HELD LIABLE. THIS SECTION 8 IS NOT INTENDED TO  NEGATE OR SUPERSEDE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY EXPRESSLY MADE BY SONY IN THIS IP AGREEMENT.     9.

MusclePharm shall not take any position for tax purposes inconsistent with such fair market value as so determined without the consent of Lender; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude MusclePharm from utilizing a different method of calculating the fair market value of the Compensation Shares for financial accounting purposes if MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer, audit committee and independent auditors shall determine in good faith that such alternative calculation of the fair market value of the Compensation Shares is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.   (c) In connection with the issuance of the Compensation Shares, but without limitation of Section 8(a) or the other terms and conditions in this Agreement, Lender hereby makes the following representations to MusclePharm regarding the Compensation Shares:   (i) Lender understands that, as of the date hereof, none of the Compensation Shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"), by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, the availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Lender's representations as expressed herein. Lender is acquiring all of the Compensation Shares for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.   (ii) Lender understands that all of the Compensation Shares will constitute \"restricted securities\" under the federal securities laws, inasmuch as it is being acquired from MusclePharm or such other company in one or more transactions not involving a public offering and that under such laws the Compensation Shares may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. The certificates representing the Compensation Shares will be endorsed with a legend to such effect. Lender has been informed and understands that (i) there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Compensation Shares, and (ii) no federal or state agency has made any finding or determination as to the fairness for public investment, nor any recommendation nor endorsement, of the Compensation Shares.   (iii)  Lender, or Lender's business and financial advisors, have substantial experience in evaluating and investing in private transactions of securities in companies similar to MusclePharm and such other company and Lender acknowledges that it can protect its own interests. Lender, or such advisors, have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its acceptance of all of the Compensation Shares of MusclePharm as compensation or otherwise.\n\n\n\nSource: MUSCLEPHARM CORP, 10-K/A, 2/8/2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (iv) Lender is an \"accredited investor\" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.   (v) Lender understands that all books, records, and documents of MusclePharm relating to it have been and remain available for inspection by him or his business and financial advisors upon reasonable notice. Lender confirms that all documents requested have been made available, and that it or such advisors have been supplied with all of the information concerning MusclePharm that has been requested.

In making each such decision, Lender has relied exclusively upon its experience and judgment, or that of such advisors, upon such independent investigations as it, or they, deemed appropriate, and upon information provided by MusclePharm in writing or found in the books, records, or documents of MusclePharm.   (vi) Lender is aware that the economic ownership of the Compensation Shares is highly speculative and subject to substantial risks. Lender is capable of bearing the high degree of economic risk and burdens of this venture, including, but not limited to, the possibility of a complete loss, the lack of a sustained and orderly public market, and limited transferability of the Compensation Shares, which may make the liquidation thereof impossible for the indefinite future.   (vii) The offer to issue the Compensation Shares as compensation to Lender was directly communicated to Lender or its business or financial advisors by such a manner that it or such advisors were able to ask questions of and receive answers from MusclePharm or a person acting on its behalf concerning this Agreement. At no time was Lender presented with or solicited by or through any leaflet, public promotional meeting, television advertisement, or any other form of general advertising.

Arbitration and Equitable Relief. 11.1. Arbitration. Except as described in Section 11.2 below, any dispute or controversy between Company and the Consultant and/or its employees or staff, including, but not limited to, those involving the construction or application of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.

The location of the arbitration shall be in the County of San Diego, California. 11.2. Availability of Injunctive Relief. Consultant acknowledges that any breach of its obligations under Articles 2 or 3 of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury for which Company shall have no adequate remedy at law.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as prohibiting Company from obtaining any other remedies otherwise available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages. 12. Miscellaneous. 12.1. Governing Law; Consent to Personal Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction. To the extent that any lawsuit is permitted under this Agreement, the Parties hereby expressly consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the County of San Diego, California. 12.2. Assignability. This Agreement will be binding upon Consultant's assigns, administrators, and other legal representatives, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.

Notwithstanding any other notice requirement in this Agreement, actual notice (e.g., phone, email, letter) to a counterparty of a delay or failure described in this provision will constitute effective notice for purposes of this provision. Regardless, however, of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any such circumstances, if for any reason supplies of or distribution logistics for Product, or feedstock for making Product, from any of Seller's existing sources are curtailed or are inadequate to meet Seller's own requirements and/or its obligations to its customers, Seller's obligation to deliver Product during such period shall be reduced to the extent necessary, in Seller's sole judgment, to apportion fairly among Seller's own requirements and its customers (whether under contract or not) such Product as received and as may be available in the ordinary and usual course of Seller's business from any existing sources of supply at the location(s) from which deliveries like those covered hereby are normally shipped. Seller shall not be obligated to purchase or obtain Product, or feedstock to make Product, to replace deliveries omitted or curtailed under this paragraph.\n\n14. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED\n\n15.

For U.S. domestic sales, if Buyer elects to export Product, Buyer shall constitute the U.S. Principal Party in Interest or Exporter for all purposes under applicable law.\n\n16. NON-US BUYERS If Buyer is a natural or legal person of any jurisdiction other than the United States and/or a State thereof, any dispute arising with respect to the transaction(s) specified herein shall be referred to three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce as in effect on the date of such referral.

Buyer's /Buyer Affiliates' custody begins when Metal Crates are loaded onto the delivering carrier at the ExxonMobil or third party warehouse and ends when Metal Crates are loaded onto the carrier for return to Global Pallet Services Limited (GPS) USA, Inc.\n\nBuyer/Buyer Affiliates must implement a system to ensure Metal Crates are not lost or damaged, and are returned in undamaged condition (normal wear and tear excepted). Buyer/Buyer Affiliates will supply to ExxonMobil upon request copies of any Bills of Lading needed to verify return shipments of Metal Crates.\n\nFor each Metal Crate not received back at Global Pallet Services Limited (GPS) and where a physical inventory determines that such Metal Crate is not in the custody of Buyer/Buyer Affiliates, Buyer/Affiliates will have 30 days from end of the calendar year to reimburse ExxonMobil as stated below.\n\nFor the purposes of this agreement, a Metal Crate is considered to be in undamaged condition if the base and all four sides are in working condition.

Terms as specified in Seller's Order Confirmation (if any) and these Standard Terms and Conditions shall constitute the only binding contract terms and conditions between the parties (the \"Agreement\") in the absence of a written agreement as described in the Clause on Written Agreement.\n\nWRITTEN AGREEMENT If there is an executed written sales contract or agreement in effect between Buyer and Seller covering Buyer's order, the terms and conditions of that contract or agreement shall prevail over any conflicting term in Seller's Order Confirmation and/or these Standard Terms and Conditions and/or Buyer's purchase order.\n\nPRICE ADJUSTMENT [*****] Buyer's failure to deliver to Seller written objection to any such change at least ten (10) days before its effective date shall constitute acceptance.

To allow for standard tolerances of scales, Seller will not consider any claims for shortages of less than one half of one percent (0.5%) of the gross weight of any shipment of packaged product or less than one half of one percent (0.5%) of the net weight of bulk shipment. Seller shall have the right at all times to appoint an independent surveyor.\n\nTAXES All prices are exclusive of taxes, duties, or other governmental charges levied on or in respect of the product or delivery thereof. Buyer shall pay or reimburse Seller for such taxes, duties or charges.\n\nRISK AND TITLE TRANSFER Risk of loss of and damage to product shall pass to Buyer in accordance with the Incoterm specified in Seller's Order Confirmation or separate sales contract. Without negating Seller's warranty obligations hereunder, Buyer assumes all risk and liability for loss, damage, or injury to the person or property of Buyer or other parties arising out of the use or possession of any Product sold hereunder. Unless stated otherwise in Seller's Order Confirmation or separate sales contract, title in product shall pass to Buyer simultaneously with risk of loss of and damage to product. However, if the product is shipped by Seller from the US, such title and risk shall pass to Buyer at the first point at which the delivering vessel crosses the outer boundary of the US Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The EEZ extends 200 nautical miles beyond the coastal baseline defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or as such term is used in the said Convention.\n\nWARRANTIES There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof, and Seller makes no warranty, expressed or implied, of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for any particular use or otherwise, except that the products sold hereunder shall meet Seller's applicable standard specifications or such other specifications as may be notified by Seller to Buyer from time to time. Buyer assumes all risk whatsoever as a result of the use of the products purchased, whether used singly or in combination with other substances or in any process.\n\nWithout limiting the foregoing, Seller does not recommend nor endorse the use of product in any medical application and specifically disclaims any representation or warranty, express or implied, of suitability or fitness for use, or otherwise with respect to product's use in any medical application. Buyer represents and warrants that no product purchased hereunder will be\n\nSource: WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES INC, 8-K, 1/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nused or resold for use in any commercial or developmental manner in connection with medical applications without Seller's prior express written acknowledgment. Further, Buyer agrees that it will make no representations, express or implied, to any person to the effect that Seller recommends or endorses the use of product purchased hereunder in any medical application.\n\nLIMITATION OF CLAIMS Seller's total liability for all claims arising hereunder or connected with the products sold hereunder, whether based in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be no greater than an amount equal to the purchase price of the products to which any such claims relate, or at the Seller's option, and only in the case of claims regarding defective or non-conforming product, to replacement of such products, provided that in all cases Buyer shall be under an obligation to mitigate any loss as far as possible. Seller shall not in any event be liable for any special, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages.\n\nSubject to the Clauses on Quantity, Transfer of Risk and Title Transfer, Buyer shall inspect and test product delivered hereunder for damage, defect or shortage immediately upon receipt and provide Seller notice of any such damage, defect or shortage within ten (10) days of receipt. Any claim must be accompanied by documents as required by Seller, including but not limited to a certified weigh scale ticket or an independent surveyor report, and Seller shall have an opportunity to an independent assessment. All claims for any cause whatsoever, whether based in contract, negligence or other tort, strict liability, breach of warranty or otherwise, shall be deemed waived unconditionally and absolutely unless Seller receives complete written details of such claim not later than [*****] after Buyer's receipt of product as to which such claim is made. Receipt will be deemed to have taken place for purposes of this subparagraph when the product has been loaded onto Buyer's transport, or offloaded from the vessel or other means of transport on which delivery has been made when delivery is arranged by Seller. LAYTIME AND DEMURRAGE Buyer shall unload tank containers, cars, trucks and barges furnished by Seller and clear products from port, or at delivery destination, within the free time specified by tariffs or time periods on file with applicable bodies, or promptly after receipt if no such tariffs or time periods are on file. Buyer shall pay charges resulting from its failure to do to Seller or directly to the common carrier upon receipt of invoice.\n\nFor bulk marine shipment, demurrage charge at load port is for account of Seller and at discharge port for Buyer's account. For sales other than FOB sales, laytime allowed, demurrage rate and applicable charter party terms shall be as specified in Seller's vessel nomination to Buyer failing which, the terms in Seller's contract of affreightment with the vessel owner shall apply and Buyer shall pay Seller or the carrier the demurrage incurred at the discharge port by Seller's stipulated deadline. Subject to the foregoing, for the first discharge terminal, laytime shall commence six (6) hours after the vessel's notice of readiness is tendered to Buyer (or its agent) or upon the vessel being all fast to the discharge terminal, whichever occurs first, and for subsequent discharge terminal(s), laytime shall commence immediately when the vessel's notice of readiness is tendered to Buyer (or its agent). Laytime shall cease upon disconnection of all cargo hoses upon completion of discharge. For FOB sales, vessels nominated by Buyer are subject to Seller's screening, inspection and acceptance process and Seller's agreement to loading-date range duration / loading-date range narrowing profile / loading-date range communication leadtime and other shipping logistics, and any claim for demurrage by Buyer shall be waived unless notice in writing of such claim is received by Seller with full supporting documentation (including the invoice and time sheet issued by the vessel) by Seller's stipulated deadline.\n\nFAILURE IN PERFORMANCE Failure by Seller to deliver on a specific date shall not entitle Buyer to repudiate this Agreement. Buyer shall not be relieved of any obligations to accept or pay for products by reason of any delay in delivery or dispatch. Furthermore, no liability shall result to either party for delay in performance or non-performance of an obligation hereunder (except an obligation to make payment) in whole or in part caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the party affected, including but not limited to acts of God, terrorist activity, transportation failure, breakdowns, equipment failure, shortage or inability to obtain product or raw material for product, or good-faith compliance with any governmental order or request (whether valid or invalid) . Regardless, however, of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any such circumstances, if for any reason supplies of product or feedstock for making product, from any of Seller's existing sources are curtailed or are inadequate to meet Seller's own requirement and/or its obligation to its customers, Seller's obligation to deliver product during such period shall be reduced to the extent necessary, in Seller's sole judgment, to apportion fairly among Seller's own requirements and its customers (whether under contract or not) such products as received and as may be available in the ordinary and usual course of Seller's business from any existing sources of supply at the location(s) from which deliveries like those covered hereby are normally shipped. Seller shall not be obligated to purchase or obtain product, or feedstock to make product, to replace deliveries omitted or curtailed under this Paragraph.\n\nMODIFICATION AND AMENDMENTS There are no oral understandings, representations or warranties between the parties that conflict with these Standard Terms and\n\nSource: WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES INC, 8-K, 1/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nConditions or the details of price, payment, shipment or delivery schedule as communicated by Seller.

Seller shall in any event have the right to set- off any claim that Seller (or its affiliate) may have against Buyer (or its affiliate), against any sum which Seller may owe to Buyer (or its affiliate).\n\nIn the event Seller requires a documentary letter of credit or a standby letter of credit, such letter of credit shall be issued by an international bank in form and substance acceptable to Seller. A clean letter of credit is to be received by Seller prior to the estimated shipment date or by such date as Seller shall agree. Seller shall have no obligation to deliver product if the letter of credit is not so received by Seller.\n\nWithout prejudice to Seller's other rights in law and contract, it is agreed that Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller from and against any dead-freight, vessel and/or port charges and payments, demurrage and/or any damages, losses or expenses incurred as a result of any delay in loading or non-delivery of any product under this Agreement arising from Buyer's failure or delay in providing the letter of credit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\nBUSINESS PRACTICES (a) Business Standards. Each party to this Agreement shall establish precautions to prevent its employees or subcontractors from making, receiving, providing or offering any substantial gifts, extravagant entertainment, payments, loans, or other considerations to the employees of the other party and/or their families and/or third parties in connection with this Agreement.\n\n(b) Compliance With Law. Each party agrees and will secure agreement by its subcontractors to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, decrees and judicial orders. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision shall be interpreted or applied so as to require any party to do, or refrain from doing, anything which would constitute a violation of, or result in a loss of economic benefit under, United States anti-boycott and other export laws and regulations. Each party represents to the other party that it shall not make any improper payments of money or anything of value to a government official (whether appointed, elected, honorary, or a career government employee) in connection with this Agreement, nor shall it make improper payments to a third party knowing or suspecting that the third party will give the payment, or a portion of it, to a government official.\n\nSource: WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES INC, 8-K, 1/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Notice of Non-Compliance.

Agreement(s) as used herein shall mean any order confirmation issued by EM or any other contractual arrangement between EM and Buyer. These general terms and conditions shall apply to and form part of all Agreements. The Agreement constitutes the complete and entire understanding and agreement between EM and Buyer. No other general terms and conditions will have an effect on the Agreement. Deviations from the Agreement, including these general terms and conditions, shall be valid only if expressly agreed in writing by the parties.\n\n2. Title to the product shall transfer from EM to Buyer simultaneously with the transfer of risks as per Incoterms. All references to Incoterms shall mean ICC Incoterms 2010.\n\n3.

If Buyer is responsible for the transport of products, Buyer shall ensure that the means of transport is clean and dry, suitable for loading and carrying the products, and complies with the safety standards of EM and with the legal standards for such means of transport. In case of non- or incomplete compliance with the above requirements, EM will be entitled not to load or cause to load this means of transportation, without any obligation to compensation.\n\n5. If delivery takes place on reusable pallets (regardless of whether they are property of EM), Buyer will maintain these pallets in good condition and make them available on request for collection by or on behalf of EM.\n\n6. EM's determination of quantity and quality shall be binding for both parties. Without prejudice to the foregoing, Buyer has the right to have a representative present at said determination, at his own cost.\n\n7. Products shall be supplied by EM at the price valid on the planned delivery date.\n\n8. Prices are exclusive of taxes (such as VAT), duties or other governmental charges. In addition to the price of the product, EM shall have the right to charge any taxes, duties or other governmental charges that now or in the future may be levied, in connection with the manufacture, sale, transportation, storage, handling, delivery, use, possession of or disposal of the product or raw materials used in it. VAT and excise tax exemptions granted on request of Buyer in accordance with legislation or administrative regulations imposed by any lawful authority, shall be the exclusive responsibility of Buyer who shall indemnify EM in respect of any VAT or excise Tax liabilities arising therefrom.\n\n9. EM will invoice Buyer and Buyer will pay the invoice in the currency stated on the invoice, without any discount, deduction or set off, so that EM's designated bank account is credited with the full invoiced amount within 30 days from the invoice date.\n\n10. Failure by Buyer to pay on the due date shall make all sums owing by Buyer to EM on any account whatsoever immediately and automatically due and payable, without prejudice to EM's right to charge automatically and without giving any notice the statutory late payment interest rate as defined in applicable legislation on combating late payment in commercial transactions.\n\n11. EM and any of its Affiliates (as herein defined) may at any time without giving notice to or making demand upon Buyer, set off and apply any and all sums at any time owing by EM and/or by any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates, against any and all sums owing by Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates to EM and/or to any of its Affiliates. An Affiliate is (1) for EM: Exxon Mobil Corporation or any company in which Exxon Mobil Corporation owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50 % or more of the voting stock and (2) for the Buyer: any company in which its ultimate holding company owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50 % or more of the voting stock.\n\n12. If one party has objective reasons to conclude that the financial status of the other party becomes impaired or unsatisfactory, or in case of late payment, it may require the other party to provide adequate securities, including cash in advance, for the timely payment of future deliveries, absent which it may suspend its supply obligations.\n\nSource: WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES INC, 8-K, 1/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Health and safety information relating to handling and use of products are in the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) that EM has sent or will send to Buyer. Buyer shall notify EM if Buyer has not received such information by the delivery date. EM will assume that Buyer has received the necessary information absent notification from Buyer. Buyer shall provide such health and safety information to anyone including without limitation its employees, contractors, agents or customers who may be exposed to the product. Buyer warrants that it possesses the necessary expertise for handling products of the type being supplied hereunder and that it will take the steps necessary to review and understand that information contained on the SDS for each product it purchases. Such data and statements are offered only for Buyer's and its users' and customers' considerations, investigation and verification.\n\n14. EM gives no guarantees or warranties, express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability, fitness for purpose or suitability of the products except that the product sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall meet the relevant EM standard specification in force at the time of loading or such other specification or requirement which may be explicitly agreed in writing between the parties. Without limiting the foregoing, EM does not recommend nor endorse the use of product(s) in any medical application and specifically disclaims any representation or warranty, express or implied, of suitability or fitness for use, or otherwise with respect to product(s)' use in any medical application. Buyer represents and warrants that no product(s) purchased hereunder will be used in or resold into any commercial or developmental manner in connection with medical applications without EM's prior express written acknowledgement. Further, Buyer agrees that it will make no representations, express or implied, to any person to the effect that EM recommends or endorses the use of product(s) purchased hereunder in any medical application. EM's maximum liability for all claims for any reason is the sales price of the product involved and EM shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damage. Claims by Buyer are waived unless made in writing within 150 days from date of (non-) delivery. Buyer shall indemnity and hold EM harmless in respect of all claims for which Buyer is liable.\n\n15. EM makes no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, that the products sold hereunder, or the use of such products, or articles made therefrom, either alone or in conjunction with other materials, will not infringe any patent or trademark rights. Buyer agrees that it will promptly notify EM of any claim or suit involving Buyer in which patent or trademark infringement is alleged with respect to the products sold hereunder, and that Buyer will permit EM, at its option and expense, to control completely the defence or settlement of any such allegation of infringement.\n\n16. Neither party shall be liable for any delay in performance or non-performance in whole or in part caused by circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party affected including but not limited to, acts of God, fire, flood, war, terrorist activity, or the threat of one of these events, criminal acts or sabotage, diminishment or failure of power, telecommunications, data systems or networks, accident, explosion, equipment breakdowns, labour disputes, shortage or inability to obtain energy, utilities, equipment, transportation, the Product, or the feedstock from which the Product is directly or indirectly derived; or good faith compliance with any regulation, direction r request (whether ultimately determined to be valid or invalid) made by governmental authority or any person or persons purporting to act for such an authority.\n\nRegardless of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any of the circumstances set forth above, if for any reason, supplies of or distribution logistics of the Product deliverable under this Agreement or of the feedstock from which the Product is directly or indirectly derived from any of EM's then existing sources of supply are curtailed or cut off, or otherwise inadequate to meet EM's own requirements and its obligations to its customers, EM shall have the option during such period of curtailment, or cessation to apportion fairly among its customers including EM's Affiliates and whether under contract or not, such Product as may be received in the ordinary course of business or manufactured at EM then existing sources.\n\nEM shall not be obliged to purchase or otherwise obtain alternative supplies of product deliverable under this Agreement, or the feedstock from which product directly or indirectly is derived. Nor shall EM be obliged to settle labour disputes, run down inventories below normal levels, adapt or vary its manufacturing plan except at its own sole discretion, or to take any steps other than in accordance with good business practice to make up inadequate supplies or to replace the supplies so curtailed or cut off. EM shall not be obliged to make up deliveries omitted or curtailed under this Agreement. Any such deficiencies in deliveries shall be cancelled with no liability to either party, it being agreed, however, that a force majeure situation hereunder shall not entitle either party to cancel this Agreement.\n\n17. In case of any material breach of the terms and conditions contained in the Agreement by one of the parties, the other party may, without giving prior written notice in the event the material breach is not cured within such notice period or without undertaking any recourse to legal proceedings, suspend its further performance, terminate the Agreement or require specific performance by the other party of the Agreement in whole or in part, without prejudice to its right to damages for any losses incurred subject to Article 14.\n\n18. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other party save in the case where such assignment is to an EM Affiliate and prior written notice has been given to the Buyer.\n\nSource: WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES INC, 8-K, 1/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n19. EM informs Buyer that any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\"individual\"), in particular business contact details of Buyer's personnel and contractors, which is communicated by or on behalf of Buyer to EM (\"personal data\"), will be subject to data processing by EM. To learn more about the processing of personal data and about individual's rights in relation to the processing, read the EM data privacy notice at http://www.exxonmobil.be/enbe/company/locations/belgium/legal-information-belgium-only Buyer shall inform its personnel and contractors and other relevant individuals of the EM data privacy notice.\n\n20. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or any other document, neither this Agreement nor any other document shall constitute an agreement by EM to take any action or refrain from taking any action that is in conflict with, penalized under or compliance with which is prohibited by the laws or regulations of the United States, the European Union (EU), any EU member State, the United Kingdom and/or Norway, as applicable. The parties furthermore represent, warrant and undertake to each other on a continuous basis that they shall comply with all applicable anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations of any government relevant to the transaction, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the applicable country legislation implementing OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in international business transactions as such laws and regulations may be updated or amended from time to time.\n\n21. To the extent permitted by law, in the event that a party becomes aware that it will or may undergo a Change of Control (\"Affected Party\") within the following three (3) Months, the Affected Party will notify the other party without delay after it becomes so aware. Together with such notification, the Affected Party will supply the other party with sufficient information to allow that other party to reasonably assess the impact that such Change of Control may have on it and/or its Affiliates, on the Affected Party's creditworthiness, and on the Affected Party's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. In the event that the other party concludes in its sole discretion that such Change of Control, if it is implemented: (a) may result in it and/or its Affiliates being subjected to any fact, matter, event, circumstance, condition or change which materially and adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect, individually or in aggregate, the business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (whether financial, trading or otherwise), prospects or operating results of it and/or its Affiliates; (b) that the Affected Party's creditworthiness may be reduced; and/or (c) that the Affected Party's ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement may be negatively affected;\n\nthen the other party may (but is not obliged to) terminate this Agreement forthwith upon notice to the Affected Party. Such termination is without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the parties that have accrued up to and including the date of termination. As used above, \"Change of Control\" means any of the following: (i) any transaction, or series of transactions, that would result in the transfer of at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity interest in a party (or of at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity interest in any business entity that owns or controls, directly or indirectly, at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity interest in a party (\"Party's Parent\")) to a single transferee or multiple transferees under common control; (ii) any transaction that would result in a Party's (or Party's Parent's) merging with one or more other entities.\n\n22. This Agreement between EM and Buyer shall be governed by the laws of Belgium (excluding its rules on conflict of laws). Neither the Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods ('ULIS'), nor the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 1980 ('CISG') shall apply. (i) If Buyer's registered office is located within the territory of the European Economic Area ('EEA'), any disputes between EM and Buyer arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Antwerp. (ii) If Buyer's registered office is located outside the territory of the EEA, any disputes arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be finally settled under the CEPANI Rules of Arbitration by three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be Brussels. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. ________________________________ * Further information on ExxonMobil Petroleum & Chemical BVBA is available on: http://www.exxonmobil.be/en-be/company/locations/belgium/legal-information-belgium-only\n\nSource: WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES INC, 8-K, 1/16/2020"

The Consultant agrees to be bound by all such obligations and restrictions that are known to Consultant and to take all action necessary to discharge the obligations of the Company under such agreements. - 3 -\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Inventions.\n\n(a) All inventions, ideas, creations, discoveries, computer programs, works of authorship, data, developments, technology, designs, innovations and improvements (whether or not patentable and whether or not copyrightable) which are made, conceived, reduced to practice, created, written, designed or developed by the Consultant, solely or jointly with others or under Consultant's direction and whether during normal business hours or otherwise, (i) during the Consultation Period if related to the business of the Company or (ii) during or after the Consultation Period if resulting or directly derived from Proprietary Information (as defined above) (collectively under clauses (i) and (ii), \"Inventions\"), shall be the sole property of the Company. The Consultant hereby assigns to the Company all Inventions and any and all related patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and other industrial and intellectual property rights and applications therefor, in the United States and elsewhere and appoints any officer of the Company as Consultant's duly authorized attorney to execute, file, prosecute and protect the same before any government agency, court or authority. However, this paragraph shall not apply to Inventions which do not relate to the business or research and development conducted or planned to be conducted by the Company at the time such Invention is created, made, conceived or reduced to practice and which are made and conceived by the Consultant not during normal working hours, not on the Company's premises and not using the Company's tools, devices, equipment or Proprietary Information. The Consultant further acknowledges that each original work of authorship which is made by the Consultant (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of this Agreement and which is protectable by copyright is a \"work made for hire,\" as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.\n\n(b) The Consultant agrees that if, in the course of performing the Services, the Consultant incorporates into any Invention developed under this Agreement any preexisting invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery or other proprietary information owned by the Consultant or in which the Consultant has an interest (\"Prior Inventions\"), (i) the Consultant will inform the Company, in writing before incorporating such Prior Inventions into any Invention, and (ii) the Company is hereby granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable worldwide license with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, to make, have made, modify, use, import, offer for sale, sell, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise exploit such Prior Inventions, without restriction, including, without limitation, as part of or in connection with such Invention, and to practice any method related thereto. The Consultant will not incorporate any invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery or other proprietary information owned by any third party into any Invention without the Company's prior written permission.\n\n(c) Upon the request of the Company and at the Company's expense, the Consultant shall execute such further assignments, documents and other instruments as may be necessary or desirable to fully and completely assign all Inventions to the Company and to assist the Company in applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents or copyrights or other rights in the United States and in any foreign country with respect to any Invention. The Consultant also hereby waives all claims to moral rights in any Inventions.\n\n(d) The Consultant shall promptly disclose to the Company all Inventions and will maintain adequate and current written records (in the form of notes, sketches, drawings and as may be specified by the Company) to document the conception and/or first actual reduction to practice of any Invention. Such written records shall be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times. - 4 -\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Non-Solicitation. During the Consultation Period and for a period of one year thereafter, the Consultant shall not, either alone or in association with others, (i) solicit, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by the Consultant to solicit, any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company; or (ii) solicit for employment, hire or engage as an independent contractor, or permit any organization directly or indirectly controlled by the Consultant to solicit for employment, hire or engage as an independent contractor, any person who is employed or engaged by the Company; provided, that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any individual whose employment with the Company has been terminated for a period of six months or longer.\n\n8. Other Agreements; Warranty.\n\n8.1 The Consultant hereby represents that, except as the Consultant has disclosed in writing to the Company, the Consultant is not bound by the terms of any agreement with any third party to refrain from using or disclosing any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information in the course of Consultant's consultancy with the Company, to refrain from competing, directly or indirectly, with the business of such third party or to refrain from soliciting employees, customers or suppliers of such third party. The Consultant further represents that Consultant's performance of all the terms of this Agreement and the performance of the services as a consultant of the Company do not and will not breach any agreement with any third party to which the Consultant is a party (including, without limitation, any nondisclosure or non-competition agreement), and that the Consultant will not disclose to the Company or induce the Company to use any confidential or proprietary information or material belonging to any current or previous employer or others.\n\n8.2 The Consultant hereby represents, warrants and covenants that Consultant has the skills and experience necessary to perform the services, that Consultant will perform said services in a professional, competent and timely manner, that Consultant has the power to enter into this Agreement and that Consultant's performance hereunder will not infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party or violate any federal, state or municipal laws.\n\n9. Independent Contractor Status.\n\n9.1 The Consultant shall perform all services under this Agreement as an \"independent contractor\" and not as an employee or agent of the Company. The Consultant is not authorized to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of, or in the name of, the Company or to bind the Company in any manner.\n\n9.2 The Consultant shall have the right to control and determine the time, place, methods, manner and means of performing the services. In performing the services, the amount of time devoted by the Consultant on any given day will be entirely within the Consultant's control, and the Company will rely on the Consultant to put in the amount of time necessary to fulfill the requirements of this Agreement. The Consultant will provide all equipment and supplies required to perform the services. The Consultant is not required to attend regular meetings at the Company. However, upon reasonable notice, the Consultant shall meet with representatives of the Company at a location to be designated by the parties to this Agreement. - 5 -\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3 In the performance of the services, the Consultant has the authority to control and direct the performance of the details of the services, the Company being interested only in the results obtained. However, the services contemplated by the Agreement must meet the Company's standards and approval and shall be subject to the Company's general right of inspection and supervision to secure their satisfactory completion.\n\n9.4 The Consultant shall not use the Company's trade names, trademarks, service names or service marks without the prior approval of the Company.\n\n9.5 The Consultant shall be solely responsible for all state and federal income taxes, unemployment insurance and social security taxes in connection with this Agreement and for maintaining adequate workers' compensation insurance coverage.\n\n10. Remedies. The Consultant acknowledges that any breach of the provisions of Section 1, 6 or 7 of this Agreement shall result in serious and irreparable injury to the Company for which the Company cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. The Consultant agrees, therefore, that, in addition to any other remedy the Company may have, the Company shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of this Agreement by the Consultant and to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (to the extent permitted by law) without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond.\n\n11. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party at the address shown above, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 11.\n\n12. Pronouns. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.\n\n13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n\n14. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Company and the Consultant.\n\n15. Non-Assignability of Contract. This Agreement is personal to the Consultant and the Consultant shall not have the right to assign any of Consultant's rights or delegate any of Consultant's duties without the express written consent of the Company. Any non-consented-to assignment or delegation, whether express or implied or by operation of law, shall be void and shall constitute a breach and a default by the Consultant. - 6 -\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction.\n\n17. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to its assets or business, provided, however, that the obligations of the Consultant are personal and shall not be assigned by Consultant.\n\n18. Interpretation. If any restriction set forth in Section 1, 6 or 7 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.\n\n19. Survival. The last sentence of Section 1 and Sections 4 through 20 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n20. Miscellaneous.\n\n20.1 No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or consent given by the Company on any one occasion shall be effective only in that instance and shall not be construed as a bar or waiver of any right on any other occasion.\n\n20.2 The captions of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.\n\n20.3 In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.\n\n[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank] - 7 -\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Consulting Agreement as of the date and year first above written.

Method 1.  (a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business  name and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with  specific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member  information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a  specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (\"Seeded Profile\"). As of  the date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over  6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an  \"Activated User.\"     (b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the  Network, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded  Profile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a  user, that user will be deemed to be an \"Activated User\" and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User.     Method 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an  Activated User and the Network will identify that user as an \"Activated User.\"     II  Royalty and Initial Bonus     1. Royalty. The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further  described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty  Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated  User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users,  respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common  stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of  common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The  form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-l and shall be referred to as the \"Royalty Warrant.\"\n\n\n\n9\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n   2. Initial Bonus. Concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to  purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant is  attached hereto as Schedule A-II and shall be referred to as the \"Bonus Warrant.\"     3. Restrictive Legend. The restricted legend for purposes of any certificate representing the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant, and the stock  certificate for shares underlying the Royalty Warrant or Bonus Warrant is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\") or  any state securities law. These shares have been acquired for investment and may not be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred, nor  will any assignee or transferee thereof be recognized by the Company as having any interest in such shares, in the absence of(i) an effective  registration statement with respect to the shares under the Act, and any other applicable state law, or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to  the Company that such shares will be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred only in a transaction which is exempt under or is  otherwise in compliance with the applicable securities laws.     ***\n\n10\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012"

It is more likely than not that: (1) PHLVIC will not be treated as the owner of the assets in an ICC Account for  federal income tax purposes; (2) the GIE, including each Certificate, will be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax  purposes; however, if the value of an ICC Account happens to be greater than zero when an Owner's life expectancy is less  than one year (which will only occur at extremely advanced ages), it is possible that the Policy could be treated as no longer  constituting an annuity contract for Federal tax purposes from that point on; (3) for all Certificate Holders on the date of GIE  issuance and during the entire period during which the GIE and each Certificate is in effect, losses with respect to the ICC  Account will be deductible under Section 165(a) of the IRC notwithstanding the existence of the GIE' conditional guarantee of  annual lifetime income payments in the event that the value of the assets in an ICC Account decreases to zero; (4) for all  Certificate Owners on the date of GIE issuance and during the entire period during which the GIE and each Certificate is in  effect, dividends on stock held in an ICC Account otherwise meeting the requirements of Section 1(h)(11) of the IRC will  constitute qualified dividend income notwithstanding the existence of a GIE and its conditional guarantee of annual lifetime  income payments in the event the value of the assets in the ICC Account decreases to zero; and (5) for each Certificate Owner  on the date of Certificate issuance and during the entire period during which the GIE and each Certificate is in effect, the  Certificate and assets in the ICC Account subject thereto will not be treated as a straddle under Section 1092 of the IRC.\n\n\n\n4.11 Ownership of GIE; No Claims Relating to GIE. Except as set forth in Section 10.01, PHLVIC and its Affiliates, as applicable, are  the exclusive legal and beneficial owner of and have good and marketable title in and to the GIE and all intellectual property  rights therein, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or character,  including any claims for infringement of intellectual property rights. For the purposes of this Section, intellectual property  includes GIE forms, specimen forms, the features of the GIE, materials filed by any of the PHL Parties with State insurance  regulators, and any other forms prepared by any of the PHL Parties or any of their Affiliates in connection with the GIE. There  are no claims, actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (arbitration or otherwise) pending against, or to the knowledge of  PHLVIC, threatened against or affecting, all or any part of the GIE\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 5 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PLIC   PLIC hereby represents and warrants to the ICC as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   - 9 -\n\n  or to the transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction Documents. To the knowledge of PHLVIC, there are no facts that  could reasonably serve as a basis for such claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding. The use and issuance of the GIE  does not and will not infringe, misappropriate, violate or dilute any intellectual property rights of any person.\n\n  5.01 Organization. PLIC is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the State of New York.\n\n  5.02 Power and Authority. PLIC has the requisite power and authority under its articles of incorporation and by-laws to enter into  and perform its duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.\n\n\n\n5.03 Corporate Action.

PLIC has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and neither such execution and delivery nor the  performance by PLIC of any of its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party will (i) violate any  provision of its articles of incorporation or by-laws (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default or an event of  default under, any indenture, mortgage, bond or other contract, license, agreement, permit, instrument or other commitment or  obligation to which it is a party or by which it is bound or (iii) materially violate any Law applicable to it or its business.\n\n  5.05 Licenses and Permits. As of the Effective Date, PLIC has, and during the term of this Agreement shall use reasonable efforts to  maintain all material licenses, permits, registrations, authorizations, orders, consents, and other approvals by each Government  Entity necessary or advisable for the performance of its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.\n\n  5.06 Compliance with Law. As of the Effective Date, PLIC shall use reasonable efforts to conduct and will continue to conduct  business operations in connection with performance of its duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it  is a party in compliance in all material respects with applicable Law.\n\n  5.07 Equipment, Facilities and Staff. PLIC has the equipment, facilities, systems, staff and assets necessary to perform its duties and  obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   - 10 -\n\n  5.08 Pending Litigation and Actions. PLIC is not subject to any current or pending litigation or regulatory actions that would  materially impair its ability to carry out its duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.\n\n\n\n5.09 Registration Statement and Prospectus. The Registration Statement, on the date of which it was declared effective, did not  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not  misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made (it being understood that no representation is made with  respect to information about ICAS or ICC provided by ICAS in writing to PHL Variable). All statements in the Registration  Statement, on the date of which it was declared effective, relating to taxation and tax effects are true in all material respects. The  Prospectus or other information contained in the Registration Statement, when disseminated or used after the effective date of  the Registration Statement, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to  make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made (it being understood that  no representation is made with respect to information about ICAS or ICC provided by ICAS or ICC in writing to PHL Variable).  PLIC shall immediately notify ICC in the event PLIC believes or has reason to believe that the representations and warranties in  this paragraph are no longer true or completely accurate.\n\n\n\n5.10 Tax Matters.

Indemnification pursuant to this Section 12.02 shall be in addition to any liability that the ICC may  otherwise have. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section, no PHL Indemnitee shall be  entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section to the extent that (a) Losses are attributable to acts, omissions  or conduct of any PHL Indemnitee that constitute willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith, or recklessness  (other than any of ICC, any of their Affiliates, or any their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,  representatives, successors or permitted assigns acting as an agent or representative of any of the PHL  Indemnitees), unless such acts, omissions or conduct were committed at the written direction of ICC Authorized  Persons, or (b) such Loss is also a Loss for which the Investor Capital Indemnitees are indemnified pursuant to  Section 12.01 of this Agreement. Each PHL Party acknowledges that neither ICAS nor any of its Affiliates shall be  deemed to have guaranteed the profitability of the GIE or any volume of sales, and no indemnification shall arise in  connection with profitability of the GIE or volume of sales.\n\n\n\n12.03 Inter-Party Claims. Any Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 12 (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall notify the  other Party or Parties from whom such indemnification is sought (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of the Indemnified Party's assertion  of such claim for indemnification, specifying the basis of such claim. The Indemnified Party shall thereupon give the  Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the documents that evidence or support such claim or the act, omission or occurrence  giving rise to such claim.\n\n  12.04 Third Party Claims.\n\n\n\n12.04.1 Each Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the assertion by any third party of any claim  with respect to which the indemnification set forth in this Article 12 relates (which shall also constitute the notice  required by Section 16.03). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon notice to the Indemnified Party within  ten business days after the receipt of any such notice, to undertake the defense of or, with the consent of the  Indemnified Party, (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), to settle or compromise such claim. The  failure of the Indemnifying Party to give such notice and to undertake the defense of or to settle or compromise  such a claim shall constitute a waiver of the Indemnifying Party's rights under this Section 12.04.1 and shall  preclude the Indemnifying Party from disputing the manner in which the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense  of such claim or the reasonableness of any amount paid by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of such claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 13 STATUS OF PARTIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   - 26 -\n\n  12.04.2 The election by the Indemnifying Party, pursuant to Section 13.03.1, to undertake the defense of a third-party claim  shall not preclude the Party against which such claim has been made also from participating or continuing to  participate in such defense, so long as such Party bears its own legal fees and expenses for so doing.\n\n\n\n13.01 Independent Contractors. Each of the PHL Parties and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and ICC and its Affiliates, on the other,  shall be deemed to be an independent contractor as to the others for all purposes.

This Agreement, the Selling Agreement, and the Memorandum of Understanding are solely  among the Parties hereto, as applicable, and are not intended to create any right or legal relationship, express or implied, among  the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors or permitted  assigns, on the one hand, and any third party, including any Certificate Owner or other person covered under a GIE, on the  other hand; provided, however, that the Investors Capital Indemnitees and the PHL Indemnitees are expressly intended to be  third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement.\n\n\n\n13.04 ICC Not Underwriter, Insurer or Producer.

If the problem is not promptly  resolved among the Parties, a PHL Parties Authorized Person and an ICC Authorized Person shall, before the end of  the first full Business Day following the date on which initial notice is provided by the non-breaching Parties,  consult with each other in good faith concerning the existence, cause and remediation of the possible breach.\n\n  14.01.1.1 If such Authorized Persons mutually determine that the problem constitutes a material breach, the  breaching Party or Parties shall promptly take such actions and make any modifications and/or  changes as are required to correct the breach, without charge to the non-breaching Parties.\n\n  14.01.1.2 If such Authorized Persons cannot mutually determine whether the problem is the result of a material  breach, then the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Section 15.02 below.\n\n  14.01.2 Indemnification.

Philips shall not reject any Purchase Order which is placed in accordance with the Forecast, the Lead Time and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, unless Philips is entitled to reject on the basis of clause 3.1 or 4.4. 4.4 Philips shall confirm to Customer the receipt of each Purchase Order issued hereunder (each, a \"Confirmation\") within seven (7) days following Philips's receipt thereof in writing or in any other mutually agreed manner of communication (e.g., EDI or email). Each Confirmation must reference Customer's Purchase Order number, confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order, include a confirmed date of Delivery (which may differ from the requested one in the Purchase Order) or, solely if permitted under this clause 4.4, advise Customer of Philips's rejection of such Purchase Order, the date of acceptance or rejection and the basis for rejection, if applicable. If Philips commences performance under such Purchase Order, Philips will be deemed to have accepted the Purchase Order. Customer may withdraw any Purchase Order prior to Philips' acceptance thereof. Philips may only reject a Purchase Order if (a) the quantity ordered by Customer in such Purchase Order is inconsistent with the quantity in the applicable Forecast in accordance with clause 3.2 (as amended pursuant to clause 3.4), (b) Philips has sent Customer a Notice of termination pursuant to clause 12 or (c) the applicable Purchase Order includes terms and conditions that supplement those contained in this Agreement, which Philips is unwilling to accept.

M&I does however need to perform regular technical maintenance (e.g., NCP maintenance), CPU IPLs, DASD installs, IHS gens, etc.).  This type of maintenance is performed between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. CST/CDT.  These activities may result in system downtime during this window.\n\n          C.   Processing Time.  M&I will process transactions in an average of 2.5 seconds for teller transactions (not to exceed six (6) seconds for five percent (5%) of all transactions per month)  and in an average of three point five (3.5) seconds (not to exceed seven (7) seconds for five percent (5%) of all transactions per month) for bank operations CRT transactions as measured over a calendar month, from the time the transaction is sent by the Customer's controller or gateway to the time the processed data is returned to the Customer's controller or gateway.  Should M&I not be able to perform in accordance with the Performance Standards because Customer failed to acquire network or equipment recommended by M&I, or such additional network or equipment as may be reasonably necessary based on the circumstances, M&I shall notify Customer in writing and Customer shall either acquire such network and/or equipment or accept the response time that is achieved.\n\n          D.

M&I may, at any time, withdraw any of the Services (other than the Core Services) upon providing ninety (90) days' prior written notice to Customer.  M&I may also terminate any of the Services immediately upon any final regulatory, legislative, or judicial\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermination that providing such Services is inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or upon imposition by any such authority of restrictions or conditions which would detract from the economic or other benefits to M&I or Customer to any element of the Services.  In the event a Service provided as part of the monthly Base Fee is terminated by M&I, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith an appropriate reduction in the monthly Base Fee.\n\n     10.3 Partial Termination by Customer.\n\n          A.

All programs (including ideas and know-how and concepts) developed by M&I are and shall remain M&I's sole property.  Any writing or work of authorship created by M&I in the course of performing the Services under this Agreement, even if paid for by Customer, shall be the property of M&I (\"Developed Software\").  M&I may make such Developed Software available to any of its other customers; provided, however, if Customer has paid for such Developed Software and M&I offers, as part of M&I's standard price list, a separate service resulting exclusively from such Developed Software, M&I will refund, or credit, to Customer a portion of any amounts paid for such Developed Software on terms and conditions agreed to by the parties prior to commencement of work on the Developed Software.\n\n11.  TERMINATION\n\n     11.1 For Convenience.  Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (\"Termination for Convenience Fee\") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.

Fifty percent of the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days following the date of Customer's notice and the remaining 50% shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date of Termination.  In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, any unamortized Conversion or other costs, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.

In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.  The Termination for Cause Fee shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.4.\n\n          B.   If Customer terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of M&I, Customer shall not be responsible for any termination fees or charges as a result thereof.\n\nREDACTED\n\n     11.4 Termination Assistance.  Commencing six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Term of this Agreement, or upon any termination of this Agreement for any reason, M&I shall provide Customer, at Customer's expense, all necessary assistance to allow the Services to continue without interruption or adverse affect to Customer and to facilitate the orderly transition of Services to Customer or its designee (\"Termination Assistance\").  At the written request of Customer, given at least 100 days prior to expiration of the Term of the Agreement, M&I shall continue to provide Customer all Services at the rates set forth in this Agreement, for a maximum period of six (6) months.  As part of the Termination Assistance, M&I shall assist Customer to develop a plan for the transition of all data processing services from M&I to Customer or its designee on a reasonable schedule developed by Customer.  Prior to providing any Termination Assistance, M&I shall deliver to Customer a good faith estimate of all such Expenses and charges including, without limitation, charges for custom programming services.  Customer understands and agrees that all Expenses and charges for Termination Assistance shall be computed in accordance with M&I's then-current rates for such products, materials and services.  Nothing contained herein shall obligate Customer to receive Termination Assistance from M&I.\n\n12.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES\n\n\n\n\n\n     12.1 By M&I.

It shall be an Event of Default on the part of the Customer if: (i) Customer becomes insolvent, or a receiver of conservator shall be appointed with respect to the Customer; or (ii) Customer shall fail to pay any sum due M&I within the prescribed time period, and such failure continues for ten days after written notice thereof from M&I; or (iii) Customer shall fail to perform any of its other obligations under this Agreement which have a material adverse effect on M&I, and such failure is not cured within 30 days after written notice from M&I.\n\n     12.3 Remedies.  Following an Event of Default, the non-defaulting party shall have the right to and commence the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 15 or to terminate this Agreement and collect its Damages.\n\n13.  DAMAGES\n\n     13.1 Direct Damages.  Customer and M&I shall be liable to the other only for direct damages arising out of or relating to their respective performance or non-performance of obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the following shall be considered direct damages for the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n          A.   Costs of recreating or reloading any of Customer's information that is lost or damaged;\n\n          B.

Neither Customer nor M&I shall be liable for, nor will the measure of any damages in any event include, any indirect, incidental, punitive, special or consequential damages or amounts for loss of income, profits or savings arising out of or relating to performance or non-performance under this Agreement.\n\n     13.3 Equitable Relief.

Customer acknowledges that M&I shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2(A) and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination.  Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.\n\n14.  INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY\n\n     14.1 Insurance.\n\n          A.   Throughout the Term of this Agreement, M&I shall maintain at all times at its own cost and expense:\n\n               1.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own separate counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnitee; provided, however (1) if the parties agree that it is advantageous to the defense for the indemnitee to employ its own counsel or (2) in the reasonable judgment of the indemnitee, based upon an opinion of counsel which shall be provided to the indemnifying party, representation of both indemnifying party and the indemnitee would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential conflicts of interest between them, then reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnitee's counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party, provided that the indemnifying party approves such counsel.  Neither the indemnifying party nor any indemnitee shall be liable for any settlement of action or claim effected without its consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnitee shall retain, assume, or reassume sole control over all expenses relating to every aspect of the defense that it believes is not the subject of the indemnification provided for in this section.  Until both (a) the indemnitee receives notice from indemnifying party that it will defend, and (b) the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnitee may, at any time after ten (10) days from the date notice of claim is given to the indemnifying party by the indemnitee, resist or otherwise defend the claim or, after consultation with and consent of the indemnifying party, settle or otherwise compromise or pay the claim.  The indemnifying party shall pay all costs of indemnity arising out of or relating to that defense and any such settlement, compromise, or payment.  The indemnitee shall keep the indemnifying party fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense.  Following indemnification as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided in this Section, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the indemnitee with respect to the matters for which indemnification has been made.\n\n15.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n     15.1 Representatives of Parties.  All disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall initially be referred to the Account Representatives (as defined in Section 18.1).  If the Account Representatives are unable to resolve the dispute within five (5) business days after referral of the matter to them, the managers of the Account Representatives shall attempt to resolve the dispute.  If, after five (5) days they are unable to resolve the dispute, senior executives of the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute.  If, after give (5) days they are unable to resolve the dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to the chief executive officers of the parties for resolution.\n\n     15.2 Continuity of Performance.

Customer shall remain the sole and exclusive owner of all Customer Data and other Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), regardless of whether such data is maintained on magnetic tape, magnetic disk, or any other storage or processing device.  All such Customer Data and other Confidential Information shall, however, be subject to regulation and examination by the appropriate auditors and regulatory agencies to the same extent as if such information were on Customer's premises.  \"Customer Data\" means any and all data and information of any kind or nature submitted to M&I by Customer, or received by M&I on behalf of Customer, in connection with the Services.\n\n     17.2 M&I Systems.  Customer acknowledges that it has no rights in any software, systems, documentation, guidelines, procedures and similar related materials or any modifications thereof provided by M&I, except with respect to Customer's use of the same during the Term to process its data.        17.3 Confidential Information.  \"Confidential Information\" of a party\n\n\n\n\n\nshall mean all confidential or proprietary information and documentation of such party, whether or not marked as such, including without limitation with respect to Customer, all Customer Data.

Each party shall instruct its employees, agents, and contractors of its confidentiality obligations hereunder and not to attempt to circumvent any such security procedures and devices.  Each party's obligation under the preceding sentence may be satisfied by the use of its standard form of confidentiality agreement, if the same reasonably accomplishes the purposes here intended.  All such Confidential Information shall be distributed only to persons having a need to know such information to perform their duties in conjunction with this Agreement.\n\n     17.5 Security.  M&I shall be responsible for, and shall establish and maintain safeguards against, a disaster, loss or alteration of the Customer Data in the possession of M&I.  Such safeguard shall be no less rigorous than that M&I uses to protect its own data of a similar nature.\n\n18.  MANAGEMENT OF PROJECT\n\n     18.1 Account Representatives.  Each party shall cause an individual to be assigned to the position of Account Representative to devote time and effort to management of the Services under this Agreement.  Neither party shall reassign or replace its Account Representative during the first year of his or her assignment without the consent of the other party, except if such individual voluntarily resigns, is dismissed for cause, or is unable to work due to his or her death or disability.\n\n     18.2 Change Control Procedures.  On or prior to the Conversion Date, M&I shall deliver to Customer the Change Control Procedures to be used by M&I to perform the Services.  At a minimum, the Change Control Procedures shall provide for prior notice to Customer of changes which materially adversely effect the quality or timeliness of the Services, in which case such change shall be made only on a temporary basis.

Customer shall have the right to notify M&I of any requirements or changes in state law which affect the provision of the Services.  Thereafter, M&I shall schedule implementation of the changes prior to the deadline imposed by the regulatory or other governmental agency having jurisdiction for such change.

M&I shall implement such change at Customer's sole cost and expense (shared equitably among all of M&I's other service bureau customers who are affected by such change).\n\n\n\n\n\n          B.   Provided that such enactments or regulations do not prohibit M&I from performing the Services for Customer, M&I shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services regardless of changes in legislative enactments or regulatory requirements.  If such changes prevent M&I from performing its obligations under this Agreement, M&I shall, when appropriate, make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and implement a suitable work around until such time as M&I can perform its obligations under this Agreement without such work around.\n\n20.  DISASTER RECOVERY\n\n     20.1 Disaster Recovery Plan.

          "context": "Exhibit 10.1 COOPERATION AGREEMENT This Cooperation Agreement (this \"Agreement\"), dated as of May 13, 2020, is by and among MG Capital Management Ltd., a Cayman Islands company limited by shares (\"MG Capital\"), Percy Rockdale LLC, a Michigan limited liability company (\"Percy Rockdale\"), Rio Royal LLC, a Michigan limited liability company (\"Rio Royal\", and together with MG Capital and Percy Rockdale, the \"MG Capital Parties\") and HC2 Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\"). Each of the MG Capital Parties and the Company are referred to herein as a \"Party\" and collectively, as the \"Parties.\" RECITALS WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the MG Capital Parties may be deemed to beneficially own 2,703,537 shares of the Company's common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the \"Common Stock\"), which represents approximately 5.8% of the Common Stock issued and outstanding on the date hereof; WHEREAS, in consideration of the agreements and obligations of the Company, as set forth in this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, the MG Capital Parties are agreeing (i) to irrevocably withdraw the notice of stockholder nomination of individuals for election as directors of the Company at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"2020 Annual Meeting\") submitted to the Company on February 13, 2020 (the \"Nomination Notice\"), and any related materials or notices submitted to the Company in connection therewith and (ii) to terminate its solicitation of proxies in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting; WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Company and the MG Capital Parties have determined that it is in their respective best interests to come to an agreement to modify the composition of the Company's board of directors (the \"Board\") and as to certain other matters, as provided herein; and WHEREAS, the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board have selected their 2020 Director Slate (as defined herein) for the 2020 Annual Meeting. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: 1. Board of Directors. (a) Appointments. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board and its committees shall take such actions (with such actions deemed to have to occurred substantially simultaneously) as are necessary (i) to increase the size of the Board from six (6) to ten (10) Directors, and (ii) to appoint each of Kenneth S. Courtis and Michael Gorzynski (the \"MG Capital Designees\") and (iii) to appoint each of Avram A. Glazer and Shelly Lombard (together with the MG Capital Designees, the \"New Directors\") to the Board. (b) Board Size. From the date of this Agreement through the completion of the 2020 Annual Meeting, the Board will not increase the size of the Board above ten (10) directors without the unanimous approval of the Board. From the completion of the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting through the end of the Standstill Period (as hereinafter defined), the Board will not increase the size of the Board above seven (7) directors without the unanimous approval of the Board. (c) Board Chairman Succession. Consistent with the actions previously taken by the Board and the Glazer Agreement, and as of the date hereof, Mr. Glazer will be appointed as Chairman of the Board, succeeding Mr. Gfeller, who is being replaced as Chairman of the Board effective as of the date hereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) New Director Information. As a condition to the New Directors' appointment to the Board and any subsequent nomination for election as a director at any future Company annual meeting of stockholders, he or she must provide any information required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing under applicable law, stock exchange rules or listing standards. (e) Date of the 2020 Annual Meeting. The Company agrees that it shall hold the 2020 Annual Meeting no later than July 8, 2020 and shall not cause or permit any delay, postponement or adjournment thereof, except for any adjournment solely due to a lack of quorum under the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated By-Laws (the \"By-Laws\"). (f) Slate of Directors for the 2020 Annual Meeting. (i) The Company agrees that, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board shall take such actions as are necessary to (i) reduce the size of the Board from ten (10) to seven (7) Directors, effective as of the 2020 Annual Meeting, and (ii) nominate each of the New Directors and Wayne Barr, Jr., Warren H. Gfeller and Philip A. Falcone (collectively, the \"2020 Director Slate\") for election to the Board at the 2020 Annual Meeting for a term expiring at the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"2021 Annual Meeting\"). The Board, based on the information provided to it, has determined that each member of the 2020 Director Slate would (i) qualify as an \"independent director\" under the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and (ii) satisfy the guidelines and policies with respect to service on the Board applicable to all non- management directors (other than Mr. Falcone). The Company agrees that, provided that each member of the 2020 Director Slate is able and willing to serve on the Board, (i) the Board will unanimously recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote to elect each member of the 2020 Director Slate as a director of the Company at the 2020 Annual Meeting, (ii) the Company will use its reasonable best efforts (which will include the solicitation of proxies) to obtain the election of the 2020 Director Slate at the 2020 Annual Meeting and (iii) the Company will use its best efforts to resist, discourage and defend against any attempt, solicitation or action by any stockholder of the Company to remove any member of the 2020 Director Slate prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will be required to use no less than the same level of efforts and to provide no less than the same level of support as was provided for its director nominees at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Any of the Company's current directors that is not standing for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting shall receive the full amount of his or her quarterly compensation for serving as non-management directors during the second quarter of 2020 (including any quarterly fee awarded and vesting of any and all equity awards for serving on, or serving as the Chair of, any committee of the Board). (g) Company Policies and Indemnification. (i) The Parties acknowledge that each of the MG Capital Designees and each other member of the 2020 Director Slate will be governed by the same protections and obligations as other non-employee directors of the Company, including, without limitation, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, related party transactions, fiduciary duties, codes of conduct, trading and disclosure policies, and other governance guidelines and policies of the Company (collectively, \"Company Policies\"), and shall have the same rights and benefits as other non-employee directors of the Company, including without limitation with respect to insurance, indemnification, compensation and fees. (ii) The Parties acknowledge that to the extent they have not already done so, within three (3) business days of the date hereof, the Company shall enter into an indemnification agreement with each of the New Directors in the form attached as Exhibit 10.20 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020. 2. Additional Agreements. (a) The MG Capital Parties shall comply, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and Associates (as hereinafter defined) to comply with the terms of this Agreement and shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such Affiliate or Associate. (b) The MG Capital Parties, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates and Associates, shall irrevocably withdraw their Nomination Notice and any related materials or notices submitted to the Company in connection therewith and shall agree to terminate any solicitation of proxies in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) The MG Capital Parties hereby agree to appear in person (including via permitted remote or virtual attendance) or by proxy at any annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders held during the Standstill Period, and agree that they shall not participate or vote in any solicitation of written consents of the Company's stockholders during the Standstill Period (unless expressly requested to do so by the Board), and that they shall vote all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the MG Capital Parties at such meeting or in such consent solicitation, (A) in favor of all directors nominated by the Board for election and against the removal of any member of the Board, (B) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to any \"say-on-pay\" proposal and (C) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to any other Company proposal or stockholder proposal or nomination presented at such meeting or solicitation of consents; provided, however, that in the event that both Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (\"ISS\") and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (\"Glass Lewis\") recommend otherwise with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal presented at an annual or special meeting held during the Standstill Period, the MG Capital Parties shall be permitted to vote in accordance with the recommendation of ISS and Glass Lewis. (d) The MG Capital Parties agree that the Board or any committee thereof, solely to fulfill the discharge of its fiduciary duties upon the advice of its legal counsel, may recuse either of Messrs. Courtis or Gorzynski by majority vote of the members of the Board (but excluding the applicable director), from the portion of any Board or committee meeting at which the Board or any such committee is evaluating and/or taking action with respect to and after the right of the recused director to be present prior to recusal (A) the exercise of any of the Company's rights or enforcement of any of the obligations under this Agreement, and (B) any transaction proposed by, or with, the MG Capital Parties, their Affiliates or Associates, as long as all other similarly situated directors are similarly recused. The Board or such committee, as applicable, may withhold from either of Messrs. Courtis or Gorznyski any material distributed to the directors to the extent directly relating to the subject of that recusal. 3. Standstill Provisions.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This communication, and certain oral statements made by our representatives from time to time may contain, forward-looking statements. Generally, forward-looking statements include information describing actions, events, results, strategies and expectations and are generally identifiable by use of the words \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"might\" or \"continues\" or similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this communication include, without limitation, any statements regarding our expectations regarding building stockholder value, future cash flow, longer-term growth and invested assets, the timing or prospects of any refinancing of HC2's remaining corporate debt, any statements regarding HC2's expectations regarding entering definitive agreements in respect of the potential divestitures of Continental Insurance and/or DBM Global, reducing HC2's leverage and related interest expense at the holding company level generally and with the net proceeds of such divestitures, reducing corporate overhead, growth opportunities at HC2's Broadcasting and Energy businesses and unlocking value at HC2's Life Sciences segment. Such statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of HC2's management and the management of HC2's subsidiaries and portfolio companies. The Company believes these judgments are reasonable, but you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and the Company's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative, that may be revised or supplemented in subsequent statements and reports filed with the SEC, including in our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. Such important factors include, without limitation, issues related to the restatement of our financial statements; the fact that we have historically identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and any inability to remediate future material weaknesses; capital market conditions, including the ability of HC2 and its subsidiaries to raise capital; the ability of HC2's subsidiaries and portfolio companies to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make upstream cash distributions; volatility in the trading price of HC2's common stock; the ability of HC2 and its subsidiaries and portfolio companies to identify any suitable future acquisition or disposition opportunities; our ability to realize efficiencies, cost savings, income and margin improvements, growth, economies of scale and other anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; difficulties related to the integration of financial reporting of acquired or target businesses; difficulties completing pending and future acquisitions and dispositions; activities by activist stockholders, including a proxy contest, consent solicitation or any unsolicited takeover proposal; effects of litigation, indemnification claims and other contingent liabilities; changes in regulations and tax laws; the risks and uncertainties associated with, and resulting from, the COVID-19 pandemic; and risks that may affect the performance of the operating subsidiaries and portfolio companies of the Company. Although HC2 believes its expectations and assumptions regarding its future operating performance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. These risks and other important factors discussed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and our other reports filed with the SEC could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this communication. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements attributable to HC2 or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. All such statements speak only as of the date hereof, and unless legally required, HC2 undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Additional Information and Where to Find It HC2 plans to file a proxy statement (the \"2020 Proxy Statement\"), together with a proxy card, with the SEC, in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the 2020 Annual Meeting.

In the performance of their obligations under this Agreement, each party shall incur Allocated Expenses directly related to the Roundup L&G Business. Each allocated Approved Expense, regardless of the party incurring it, shall be reimbursed provided such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the Allocation Rules set forth for each category of cost and service per country or region, as the case may be, in Schedule 3.3(c) attached hereto (\"Allocated Expense\").\n\nSection 3.4 Resolution of Disputes Arising under Article 3.

If the parties cannot agree upon such Independent Accountant within such time frame, then the Independent Accountant shall thereupon be selected by the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"), with preference being given by the AAA in making such selection to any one of the \"Big Four\" accounting firms (except for any firm which performs accounting services for either party) willing to perform the services required hereunder. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed to act within thirty (30) days to resolve the dispute, and its decisions with respect to the dispute shall be final and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant with respect to the settlement of the dispute shall be borne equally by the parties.\n\nSection 3.5 Fixed Contribution to Expenses.\n\n(a) Amount and Purpose. Each Program Year the Agent shall make a fixed contribution to the overall Expenses of the Roundup L&G Business in an amount equal to eighteen million U.S. Dollars ($18,000,000) (\"Contribution Payment\"). Such Contribution Payment shall be payable by the Agent to Monsanto in twelve equal monthly installments which shall be due on the first day of each month and shall not be subject to any \"set-off\".\n\nSection 3.6 Commission.\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Amount of Commission. In consideration to the Agent for performance of its duties and obligations hereunder, the Agent shall be entitled to a Commission (\"Commission\"). Such Commission shall represent a percentage of the Program EBIT realized by the Roundup L&G Business which percentage shall be (i) for Program Years 2017 and 2018, 50% of the Program EBIT and (ii) for Program Years 2019 and thereafter, 50% of the Program EBIT in excess of $40MM (such $40MM threshold, the \"Commission Threshold\"). The parties agree that the Commission Threshold may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties following the inclusion or exclusion of either new or existing countries in the Included Markets, including Activated Included Markets, or Excluded Markets, as applicable.\n\n(b) Payment of Commission. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each month, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall determine whether a Commission becomes payable, i.e., whether the cumulative Program EBIT for the Program Year up to the preceding month equals an amount in excess of the First Commission Threshold. If so, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent's designated account for the payment of the applicable Commission pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).\n\n(c) Final Determination.

If within such fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by Monsanto, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the parties shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.\n\nSection 3.7 [Intentionally deleted]\n\nSection 3.8 Additional Commission.\n\n(a) The parties acknowledge that Monsanto currently sells Glyphosate-based products under the Roundup trademark, directly or indirectly, to professional, industrial and agricultural users (\"Roundup Ag Products\"). Monsanto acknowledges that one of such Roundup Ag Products, the 2.5 gallon SKU containing 41% concentration of Glyphosate with the Brand name Roundup Pro (the \"Roundup Pro SKU\"), is currently being sold through Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States and may be purchased by consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market. Monsanto also acknowledges its obligations pursuant to Section 6.13(b) hereof.\n\n(b) The Agent is exclusively distributing and managing the sale of the Roundup Pro SKU in Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States. The parties acknowledge that the Agent purchases the Roundup Pro SKU from Monsanto (or a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) for the Agent's own account in its capacity as a distributor and not as a marketing agent, and the sales resulting from such Roundup\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nPro SKU shall not be included in the Program Sales Revenues hereunder. In the event that the Agent is terminated as an exclusive distributor of the Roundup Pro SKU by Monsanto (or by a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU), any subsequent sales of the Roundup Pro SKU by parties other than Agent in the Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States will be subject to the provisions of Section 3.8(c) below.\n\n(c) Except to the extent provided in Section 3.8(b) above, on and after the Effective Date, Monsanto shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Roundup Ag Products are not sold, directly or indirectly, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets. In the event that in the normal course of business the Agent determines based on satisfactory evidence that a material amount of additional Roundup Ag Products, above Program Year 2016 sales levels (such amount, the \"Historical Threshold\"), are being sold directly by Monsanto (or directly by any successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) through Lawn and Garden Channels in the Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to include, subject to the principles set forth in Section 3.8(d), an appropriate percentage of such incremental sales that exceed the Historical Threshold to reflect such Lawn and Garden Use within the definition of Program Sales Revenues so that the Agent receives credit therefor for purposes of calculating the Agent's Commission, or such other compensation as required to fully compensate the Agent for lost Commission as a result of such sales of Roundup Ag Products above the Historical Threshold as the Parties may agree (collectively, the \"Additional Amount\").\n\n(d) In implementing the foregoing, the parties shall follow the following principles: (i) that Monsanto's sales of Roundup Ag Products are not intended for Lawn and Garden Use and that Monsanto shall not sell Roundup Ag Products directly or promote the indirect sale thereof, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets and (ii) that there shall be no transfer of historical or future sales of Roundup Ag Products in the Ag Market into Program Sales Revenues. Furthermore, the parties acknowledge that Roundup Ag Products having a formulation consisting of 41% or more Glyphosate and in container sizes over 2.5 gallons in the United States or over one liter in the other Included Markets shall be presumed to have no Lawn and Garden Use and therefor that sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall not be deemed to compete with Roundup Products in a manner that would justify adjustment of the calculation of Program Sales Revenues; provided that if the Agent is able to demonstrate to the Steering Committee that a material change in the amount of such Roundup Ag Products above the Historical Threshold are being sold through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith pursuant to Section 3.8(c) to adjust the calculation of Program Sales Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Agent, any of its Affiliates and/or Seamless Control LLC (\"Seamless Control\"), but only if Seamless Control is then controlled by Agent or an Affiliate of Agent, sells, directly or indirectly, Roundup Ag Products through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets above the Historical Threshold, sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall (i) to the extent in excess of the Historical Threshold, be added to the Historical Threshold and (ii) not be considered by Monsanto or the Agent when determining the Additional Amount.\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) During the 2014 Program Year and for each Program Year thereafter, in consideration for the Agent's marketing, distribution and sales of Roundup 365, for the 2014 Program Year, and for each Program Year thereafter, if 365 Gross Profits exceed USD $10MM in a Program Year, the Agent shall be paid an amount equal to 7% of the 365 Gross Profits for such Program Year (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the first USD $10MM of the 365 Gross Profits). The amount that becomes payable under this Section 3.8(e) with respect to a Program Year shall be included as a separate line item in the Commission Statements delivered by Agent to Monsanto and the payment of such amount shall be in addition to the Commission otherwise payable under Section 3.6(b) and shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 3.8(e).\n\nARTICLE 4 - ROUNDUP L&G BUSINESS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE\n\nSection 4.1 Underlying principles for the Roundup L&G Business Management Structure.\n\n(a) The Roundup L&G Business management structure, as described in this Article, has been created for the purposes of fostering and promoting the following interests of the parties:\n\n(i) Common Interests:\n\n(A) achieve the maximum volume and profit levels for the Roundup Business;\n\n(B) continue to strengthen the Roundup brand; and\n\n(C) leverage the strengths of both parties while working together in a constructive and harmonious way.\n\n(ii) Monsanto's Interests:\n\n(A) retain ability to resume full management of the Roundup Business upon termination of this Agreement;\n\n(B) retain control over key business decisions; and\n\n(C) provide global stewardship of the Roundup brand.\n\n(iii) The Agent's Interests:\n\n(A) manage the Roundup Business within the parameters of approved Annual Business Plans.\n\n(b) The parties understand that such structure may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties provided any such change shall take into account the respective interests of each party as described hereunder.\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Steering Committee.\n\n(a) Appointment. Monsanto and the Agent shall each appoint by April 1 of each year two (2) executives to a steering committee (\"Steering Committee\") provided, however, any vacancy shall be filled in such a manner that the parties shall maintain their respective proportionate representation on the Steering Committee and that upon failure by either party to appoint said two (2) executives by such time, the two (2) executives previously appointed by such party shall be deemed appointed for another Program Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of the Steering Committee for the Program Year 2017 shall be the individuals whose names are set forth as Schedule 4.2(a) attached hereto. Either party may also invite a reasonable number of additional members from their respective organizations to attend meetings of the Steering Committee as they deem appropriate; provided, that, except to the extent provided under this Agreement, such additional members in attendance shall not have any voting rights.\n\n(b) Meetings, Quorum and Voting Requirements.\n\n(1) Meetings. The Steering Committee shall meet at least once a year for purposes of approving the Annual Business Plan no later than September 15 of every calendar year.

The quorum for any meeting of the Steering Committee shall require the participation of all four (4) members except that any member shall be deemed present when participating via phone or video conference. Any decisions by the Steering Committee may be taken by the affirmative vote of a majority of three of the members of the Steering Committee. In the event of a deadlock, when a particular vote is divided equally between the four members, the matter shall be submitted to Monsanto's senior executive responsible for the oversight of the Roundup L&G Business (as determined by Monsanto) (the \"Monsanto Senior Executive\"), who shall have the exclusive discretion to resolve the matter and such decision shall bind the Steering Committee to such action or inaction. Notwithstanding any future assignment of this Agreement to a third party by reason of a Roundup Sale, the Monsanto Senior Executive shall retain its right of veto in case of deadlock of the Steering Committee.\n\nFor every meeting of the Steering Committee, minutes shall be kept and circulated for approval to all four members. Every decision of the Monsanto Senior Executive shall also be recorded in writing and distributed to the members of the Steering Committee.\n\n(c) Authority.

The Business Units shall be responsible for:\n\n(i) taking any and all necessary actions to implement the approved Annual Business Plan and strategic plans, as may be amended from time to time, either by mutual agreement of the Business Unit and the Global Support Team or by the Steering Committee as described in Section 4.2(c);\n\n(ii) managing the day-to-day Roundup L&G Business;\n\n(iii) developing and submitting, in cooperation with the Global Support Team all strategic and Annual Business Plans;\n\n(iv) communicating, in writing or via meetings, on a regular basis, with the Global Support Team on all significant issues affecting the Roundup L&G Business; and\n\n(v) notifying the Global Support Team of any deviation to the Annual Business Plan, which, in their view, is reasonably likely to have a financial impact on the Program EBIT of at least $500,000 or constitutes a significant deviation from a non-financial item approved in the Annual Business Plan (\"Significant Deviation\").\n\nSection 4.4 Global Support Team.\n\n(a) Appointment. Monsanto shall maintain a team of up to 10 employees, or such number as the Agent and Monsanto may agree to from time to time, to support the Roundup\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\nL&G Business on a full-time basis as well as other employees who will support the Roundup L&G Business on a part-time basis (the \"Global Support Team\").

The Global Support Team shall be responsible to:\n\n(i) participate actively in the development of all strategic and Annual Business Plans;\n\n(ii) act as a liaison between any of Monsanto's functions or departments providing a support service to the Roundup Business (such as R&D, regulatory, etc.) and monitor the quality of services rendered;\n\n(iii) provide stewardship for the Roundup brand image worldwide;\n\n(iv) prepare internal assessments of the performance of the Roundup L&G Business for Monsanto management;\n\n(v) participate in planned key customer interactions and program presentations, either by participation in meetings or in preparatory sessions therefor;\n\n(vi) review and approve any material change or deviation in consumer communication, mass media, packaging design or any other marketing tactic that directly impacts the consumer perception and interface with the brand which may occur from time to time; and\n\n(vii) review and approve any Significant Deviation from the Annual Business Plan; and upon failure to agree with the Business Unit, prepare a recommendation to submit to the Steering Committee for resolution, provided that the Business Unit may similarly prepare a recommendation to submit to the Steering Committee.\n\nARTICLE 5 - DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF MONSANTO\n\nSection 5.1 Monsanto's Obligations and Rights. Subject to Article 3, unless and until expressly directed otherwise by the Business Units, with the prior written approval of the Steering Committee Monsanto shall continue to support the Roundup L&G Business by performing necessary services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times during the term of this Agreement, Monsanto shall be solely responsible for the following functions:\n\n(a) Research and Development. Monsanto shall (i) in its sole discretion, continue to develop new Glyphosate- based non-selective herbicide formulations and (ii) exercise commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith with the Agent to develop other non-selective herbicide formulations, in each case, as more particularly as described in Section 6.10 hereof;\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Regulatory Compliance.

For all reports, the data will include current period and current YTD, forecasts and budgets; and comparisons with same period and YTD and forecasts and budgets for the year previous. Specifically, the Agent shall provide the following reports:\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Weekly Reports.

Further, the Agent shall ensure that the appropriate personnel are compensated in a manner reasonably intended to encourage them to promote the sale of Roundup Products in a commercially reasonable manner generally consistent with other products or product lines, of similar volume or having similar margins (as compared to the overall Roundup P&L margins), of the Agent.\n\nSection 6.5 Insurance. The Agent, shall, during the term of this Agreement, maintain full insurance against the risk of loss or damages to the Roundup Products for any Agents' warehouse where Roundup Products are under the custody of the Agent and, upon request, shall furnish Monsanto with satisfactory evidence of the maintenance of said insurance. Further, each party shall make all contributions and pay all payroll taxes required under federal social security laws and state unemployment compensation laws or other payments under any laws of a similar character as to its own personnel involved in the Roundup L&G Business (including any purported \"independent\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\ncontractors\" subsequently classified by any authority under any Law, as an employee) in connection with the performance of this Agreement.\n\nSection 6.6 Liens. Subject to the provisions of any existing intercreditor agreement to which Monsanto is currently a party (as the same may be amended, modified or terminated) and except as may otherwise be agreed to by Monsanto, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld in the case of similar arrangements with existing or future institutional lenders, the Agent agrees not to allow any liens or encumbrances of any nature to attach to Roundup Products. At Monsanto's request, the Agent, sub-agent, or sub-distributor shall execute such financing statements, security agreements and other documents as Monsanto may reasonably request to create, perfect, and continue in effect its security interests hereunder.\n\nSection 6.7 Promoting Safe Use-Practices. Roundup Products may be or become hazardous unless used in strict accordance with Monsanto's product labels. The Agent shall use commercially reasonable methods to inform and familiarize its employees, agents, Customers, contractors (including warehousemen and transporters) and others who may handle or use Roundup Products of the potential hazards pertaining thereto (including accidental breakage or fire), and shall stress the safe use and application of Roundup Products in strict accordance with Monsanto's product labels.

The Agent shall cooperate with Monsanto, and promptly take such actions as requested by Monsanto, with respect to any defective product including any \"stop-sales\" or recalls for Roundup Products.\n\nSection 6.10 New Roundup Products.\n\n(a) During the term of this Agreement, Monsanto covenants and agrees to first offer (the \"Product Offer\") to the Agent, with respect to the Included Markets, the exclusive agency and distribution rights to any newly created non-selective herbicide product, which is not marketed for Lawn and Garden Use as of the date of this Agreement, and which Monsanto, in its exclusive, reasonable discretion, determines to be suitable for sale as a new product for Lawn and Garden Use (the \"New Product\"); provided, however, that for the Lawn and Garden Market, that any new product containing Glyphosate or another non- selective herbicide shall be considered to be a New Product. The Product Offer shall be in writing, shall be in sufficient detail describing such New Product, and shall be made within sixty (60) days of the date of commercialization of such New Product for uses other than Lawn and Garden Use. In no event shall Monsanto, directly or indirectly, commercialize any New Product for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets without first offering such New Product to the Agent pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10. If the Agent agrees in writing\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nwithin ninety (90) days of receipt of the Product Offer to accept the New Product, then such New Product shall be, without further action or amendment, included within the definition of Roundup Products and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In such event, the parties shall adjust the Commission Thresholds to reflect this additional source of revenue unless the New Product is a Glyphosate-based product or an improvement of any existing Roundup Products in which case the Commission Thresholds shall remain the same. If the Agent fails to agree in writing to accept the Product Offer within such ninety (90) days of receipt, then Monsanto shall have the exclusive right to manufacture, package, promote, distribute, and sell such New Product in the Included Markets, regardless of any actual or potential conflict with the terms of Agreement.\n\n(b) During the term of this Agreement, the Agent may, from time to time, propose that Monsanto utilize a different formulation of non-selective herbicide product for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets that may or may not contain Glyphosate (an \"Agent Proposed Product\") and offer the Agent the exclusive agency and distribution rights to such Agent Proposed Product under this Agreement. Any Agent Proposed Product proposal shall contain supporting detail describing the Agent Proposed Product. The Agent shall supply Monsanto with any information Monsanto reasonably requests as part of its evaluation. Monsanto shall not unreasonably delay its evaluation of an Agent Proposed Product following receipt of any such information. Monsanto shall give good faith consideration to all Agent Proposed Products, and provided that Monsanto shall have the sole discretion in branding any Agent Proposed Product, Monsanto shall not unreasonably refuse to submit to the Agent a Product Offer for an Agent Proposed Product under Section 6.10(a) that is, in Monsanto's reasonable discretion, commercially attractive, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other material aspects, including, without limitation, any possible effect of such Agent Proposed Product on Monsanto's overall business and business prospects.\n\n(c) The Agent hereby grants Monsanto an exclusive (even with respect to the Agent and its Affiliates), non- transferrable, royalty-free license and right to use the trademarks EcoSense and Path Clear (Trademark Application No. 1430287) in Canada (such trademarks, the \"Canada Marks\"), only in connection with Natural Products (as defined below) in the natural non-selective weedkiller category for Lawn & Garden Use during the term of this Agreement. Monsanto agrees to use the Canada Marks in a manner consistent with the form and style of such trademarks as used by the Agent, or as otherwise agreed in writing with the Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent currently uses and/or may in the future use the Canada Marks on products in categories other than non-selective weedkillers for Lawn & Garden Use, and the license granted to Monsanto herein shall not affect or restrict the Agent's rights in such other categories. Such license shall terminate automatically upon any expiration or termination of the term of this Agreement applicable to Canada. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be interpreted as granting Monsanto a license to the Canada Marks outside of Canada or outside the category specified in this Section 6.10(c). The Agent represents and warrants that it is a licensee with the right to sublicense the Canada Marks, and that Monsanto's use of the Canada Marks, as described herein, shall not infringe upon the rights of any third party. The Agent agrees to hold harmless, indemnify, and defend Monsanto from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from a breach of this warranty by the Agent. The Agent agrees to carry out at its expense, all procedures necessary to register and maintain the Canada\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks in full force and effect and Monsanto agrees to cooperate with the Agent in providing any product sample or other required information to assist in the maintenance and renewal of the Canada Marks. Monsanto acknowledges OMS Investments, Inc.'s exclusive ownership of all right, title and interest in and to the Canada Marks and agrees that Monsanto's use of the Canada Marks shall inure to the benefit of OMS Investments, Inc. Monsanto further agrees that it will in no way dispute, impugn or attack the validity of said Canada Marks or OMS Investments, Inc.'s or the Agent's rights thereto.\n\n(d) The Agent hereby grants to Monsanto exclusive access to the registrations for an acetic acid/citric acid nonselective weedkiller formulation in Canada. The parties will agree on the mutually acceptable details and mechanics of access and appropriate registration/labeling rights, the cost of which will be included in the Roundup P&L. Access to the then-current registrations shall continue in perpetuity, on a nonexclusive basis, following any future termination or expiration of this Agreement, enabling Monsanto or its successors to market and sell such formulations following such termination under trademarks that are different from the trademarks licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c).\n\n(e) Together, the respective trademark licenses and registration access provided pursuant to this Section 6.10 result in the following product: an acetic acid/citric acid nonselective weedkiller formulation under the EcoSense brand in Canada and an acetic acid nonselective weed killer formulation under the Path Clear brand in Canada (collectively, the \"Natural Products\"). Any Natural Product marketed and/or sold under a different brand name in Canada shall be deemed to be a Natural Product and subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Natural Products will be included in the Roundup P&L and shall be subject to the same terms, rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement as are the Roundup Products, except as modified by this Section 6.10. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any improvements to the existing Natural Products formulations in Canada during the respective term of this Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto access to such improvements and the improved products will be included in the Roundup P&L on the same terms as agreed for the current formulations of the Natural Products. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any new natural nonselective weedkiller products (including, without limitation, any herbicidally active substances which are plant extracts, including those derived from oleic acid or which are derived from plant extracts by processing including active substances) in Canada during the respective term of this Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto a right of first refusal to include such new products in the Roundup P&L on the same terms as agreed for the current Natural Products, and if accepted, such new products will become Natural Products. In the event that the Agent offers in writing a product to Monsanto pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10(e) and Monsanto does not accept such product in writing within 90 days of the Agent's offer, the Agent may market such product at its own discretion utilizing an alternative trademark from those licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c) (which alternative trademark is not identical or materially similar to the Canada Trademarks.\n\n(f) The marketing, sale and distribution of each of the Natural Products in Canada shall be governed in all respects by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the calculation of the Commission pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof. Following the inclusion of the Natural Products in the Roundup L&G Business in Canada, and fully consistent\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the performance standards and requirements of Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement, the performance of the Roundup L&G Business will be evaluated based on the total results of the business, including from current Roundup Products, the added Natural Products, and any future products added to the Roundup L&G Business. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Annual Business Plan, the Agent shall continue to promote Roundup Products in the manner described in Section 2.2(a)(7). The parties will ensure that marketing, promotional and selling plans promote the sale of the Natural Products in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement and complementary to Roundup Products, and does not directly or indirectly disparage or advertise against Roundup Products, as set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, in addition to marketing and selling the Natural Products in such a manner to existing Customers, the Agent will use its best efforts to target retailers and customers who do not currently purchase Roundup Products. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent hereby agrees that matters relating to the Naturals Products shall be included in the Annual Business Plan.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the letter agreement dated February 26, 2010 between the Agent and Monsanto shall survive in full force and effect in its entirety.\n\n(h) No provision of this Section 6.10 should be understood, explicitly or implicitly, as an amendment of the noncompetition provisions of this Agreement, or a relinquishment by either party of their rights or waiver of their obligations except as expressly set forth in this Section 6.10.\n\nSection 6.11 Additional Roundup Products.\n\n(a) Each product listed in Schedule 6.11(a) (an \"Additional Roundup Product\") shall be included in the definition of \"Roundup Products\" for the purposes of this Agreement; provided, that, such Additional Roundup Products shall only be considered \"Roundup Products\" with respect to those countries set forth in the column titled \"Included Markets\" opposite such Additional Roundup Product in Schedule 6.11(a).\n\n(b) For purposes hereof, \"Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data\" shall mean the formula for the Additional Roundup Products, the raw material specifications, analytical methods, and other information as provided in the Quality Assurance Manual (as defined in the Formulation Agreement), the instructions and know how associated with formulating the Additional Roundup Products and any and all data related to the Additional Roundup Products required to make, sell, offer for sale, register with federal, state, or territorial government authorities (as may be required by law), and support and defend marketing claims for, the Additional Roundup Products in the United States and its territories. Such data may include, but is not limited to, validations of field efficacy, stability testing data, and toxicology studies. The Agent shall make all Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data available to Monsanto. For the avoidance of doubt, Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data shall not include any data which originated with Monsanto.\n\n(c) The Agent hereby grants to Monsanto, during the term of this Agreement, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non- transferable and non-assignable license (without the right to\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nsublicense, except as specifically set forth in Section 6.11(h)) to use the Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data for the purpose of and to the limited extent necessary to register each of the Additional Roundup Products with federal, state, or territorial government authorities (as may be required by law) in the United States and its territories. To the Agent's knowledge, the Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data does not infringe or otherwise conflict with any trademarks, registrations, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party and none of the Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data is being infringed upon by a third party.\n\n(d) Upon the termination of this Agreement, the license granted in Section 6.11(c) above shall convert to a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and non-assignable license (without the right to sublicense, except as specifically set forth in Section 6.11(h) below) to use the Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data to make, sell and offer for sale, in the Included Markets for each such Additional Roundup Product, products comparable to such Additional Roundup Products, and to the limited extent necessary, to register such products with federal, state or territorial government authorities (as may be required by law) in the United States and its territories.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent at all times shall own and retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data.\n\n(f) The Agent hereby represents and warrants that it is a licensee, with the right to sublicense, the trademarks used in connection with the Additional Roundup Products as set forth on Schedule 6.11(f) in the column titled \"Additional Roundup Products Trademarks\" set forth opposite each Additional Roundup Product in Schedule 6.11(f) (the \"Additional Roundup Products Trademarks\") and that it has the right to sublicense each of the Additional Roundup Products Trademarks for the term of the Additional Roundup Trademarks Licenses and for the purposes set forth therein without reservation. To the Agent's knowledge, Monsanto's use of the Additional Roundup Products Trademarks in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Additional Roundup Trademarks Licenses shall not, and the Additional Roundup Products Trademarks do not, infringe any trademarks, registrations, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party and none of the Additional Roundup Products Trademarks are currently being infringed upon by a third party.

Except as necessary for its performance under this Agreement, except as may be required by the federal securities laws or other applicable laws and except to the extent required under certain existing agreements to which Monsanto is a party (i.e., AHP Merger Agreement), neither party shall at any time or in any manner, either directly or indirectly, and neither party shall permit its employees to use, divulge, disclose or communicate to any person or entity any \"confidential information\" of the other party.

Except as provided for in Section 3.8, Monsanto covenants and agrees that for the Noncompetition Period, Monsanto will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, any \"Competitive Business.\" A Competitive Business shall be any business which, anywhere within the Included Markets, (x) manufactures, sells, markets or\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributes any non-selective weed control product, whether residual or non-residual, for Lawn and Garden Use or (y) competes with the Roundup L&G Business; provided, however, this Section 6.13(b) shall not apply to those actions of Monsanto or any Affiliate (i) to the extent such actions are expressly contemplated by this Agreement, for the duration of this Agreement, (ii) to the extent that immediately upon termination of this Agreement for whatever reason Monsanto or any Affiliates or successor to the Roundup L&G Business shall continue to operate the Roundup L&G Business without infringing this covenant, or (iii) to the extent that Monsanto's interest in a Competitive Business, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, is equal to or less than 5%.\n\n(1) In the event any Exclusive Mexican Business makes a material change in its business model to target sales to consumers outside of the Lawn and Garden Market, Monsanto will notify the Agent in writing that it wishes to begin selling Mexican Roundup Ag Products to such identified business. The Agent will have thirty (30) days to provide any written objection to Monsanto's request. If the Agent does not object to the request, such identified Exclusive Mexican Business will no longer remain exclusive to the Agent. If the Agent objects to Monsanto's request, Monsanto shall have the ability to raise its request to the Steering Committee for final determination. Monsanto shall continue to maintain the right to sell Mexican Roundup Ag Products, labeled for the Ag Market, regardless of size, to any business that markets and makes sales to the Ag Market in Mexico, regardless of whether that business also markets and makes sales to consumers for use in, on or around residential homes, residential lawns and residential gardens, and such sales shall not constitute a violation of Section 6.13(b) of this Agreement. Monsanto's Mexican Roundup Ag Products shall not be included in the Program Sales Revenue, regardless of SKU size.\n\n(c) Agent's Covenant. The Agent covenants and agrees that during the Noncompetition Period, the Agent will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, any Competitive Business; provided, however, this Section 6.13(c) shall not apply to those actions of the Agent or any Affiliate (i) to the extent such actions are expressly contemplated by this Agreement, for such term of this Agreement; (ii) to the extent such actions relate to the products listed on Exhibit D hereto in the countries listed therein, the products that the Agent either owns, has contracted to purchase or entered into a letter of intent with respect to as of the Effective Date and such additional products as the parties may from time to time agree (the \"Permitted Products\"); (iii) to the extent that the Agent's interest in a Competitive Business, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, is equal to or less than 5%; or (iv) to any separate agreement with Monsanto with respect to transgenic technology sharing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.13(c), the Agent shall have the right to market and make sales of Roundup Products labeled for Lawn and Garden Use to any business that markets and makes sales to Lawn and Garden Channels in Mexico regardless of whether that business also makes sales to the Ag Market in Mexico, and such sales shall not constitute a violation of Section 6.13(c) of this Section 6.13(c).\n\n(d) Non-Solicitation by Monsanto. Monsanto agrees that for the duration of the Noncompetition Period and for the two years thereafter, without the prior written consent of the Agent, it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to (i) solicit for employment any person\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nthen employed by the Agent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) knowingly employ any employee of the Agent or any of its Affiliates who voluntarily terminates such employment with the Agent (or such Affiliate) after the Effective Date, until three months have passed following termination of such employment.\n\n(e) Non-Solicitation by the Agent. The Agent agrees that for the duration of the Noncompetition Period, without the prior written consent of Monsanto, it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to (i) solicit for employment any person then employed who works primarily with Roundup Products or with other products with Lawn & Garden Uses (\"Lawn & Garden Employee\") by Monsanto or any of its Affiliates or (ii) knowingly employ any Lawn & Garden Employee of Monsanto or any of its Affiliates who voluntarily terminates such employment with Monsanto (or such Affiliate) after the Effective Date, until three months have passed following termination of such employment.\n\n(f) Consideration. The consideration for the agreements contained in this Section 6.13 are the mutual covenants contained herein, the agreement of the parties to consummate the purchase of the Non-Roundup Assets, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged.\n\n(g) Modification. In the event a court (or other authority) refuses to enforce the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.13, either because of the scope of the geographical area specified in this Section 6.13, the duration of the restrictions, or otherwise, the parties hereto expressly confirm their intention that the geographical areas covered hereby, the time period of the restrictions, or such other provision, be deemed automatically reduced to the minimum extent necessary to permit enforcement.\n\n(h) Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge and agree that the extent of damages to one party (the \"non- breaching party\") in the event of an actual or threatened breach of this Section 6.13 by the other party (the \"breaching party\") may be impossible to ascertain and there may be available to the non-breaching party no adequate remedy at law to compensate the non-breaching party in the event of such an actual or threatened breach by the breaching party. Consequently, the parties agree that, in the event that either party breaches or threatens to breach any such covenant or agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy or relief to which it may be entitled, including without limitation, money damages, to seek to enforce any or all of such agreements or covenants against the breaching party by injunctive or other equitable relief ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nSection 6.14 Industrial Property.\n\n(a) Monsanto represents and warrants that Monsanto or Affiliates are the exclusive owners of the trademarks, trade names, packages, copyrights and designs used in the sale of Roundup Products (hereinafter referred to as \"Industrial Property\"). To Monsanto's knowledge, the conduct of the Roundup L&G Business as now being conducted and the use of the Industrial Property in the conduct of the Roundup L&G Business, do not infringe or otherwise conflict with any trademarks, registrations, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, nor has any claim been made that the conduct of the Roundup L&G Business as now being conducted\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\ninfringes or otherwise is covered by the intellectual property of a third party, except for any conflict or infringement which would not have a material adverse effect. To the knowledge of Monsanto, none of the Industrial Property is currently being infringed upon by a third party.\n\n(b) The Agent acknowledges the validity of the trademarks which designate and identify Roundup Products. The Agent further acknowledges that Monsanto is the exclusive owner of the Industrial Property.\n\n(c) The Agent agrees that, to the extent it uses Industrial Property, such Industrial Property shall be used in its standard form and style as it appears upon Roundup Products or as instructed in writing by Monsanto. No other letter(s), word(s), design(s), symbol(s) or other matter of any kind shall be superimposed upon, associated with or shown in such proximity to the Industrial Property so as to tend to alter or dilute such Industrial Property, and the Agent further agrees not to combine or associate any of such Industrial Property with any other industrial property. The generic or common name of the type of product (e.g., \"non-selective herbicide\") must always follow Roundup Products' trademarks.\n\n(d) In all advertisements, sales and promotional or other printed matter in which any Industrial Property appears, the Agent shall identify itself by full name and address and state its relationship to Monsanto. In all such material, the Roundup trademark shall be identified as a trademark owned by Monsanto Company. In the case of a registered trademark, a ® shall be placed adjacent to the trademark with the ® referring to a footnote reading \"® Registered trademark of Monsanto Company.\" In the case of unregistered trademarks, a \"TM\" shall be placed adjacent to the trademark with the \"TM\" referring to a footnote reading \"TM Trademark of Monsanto Company.\"\n\n(e) On its letterheads, business cards, invoices, statements, etc., the Agent may identify itself as a distributor for the Industrial Property.\n\n(f) The Agent agrees that it will never use any Industrial Property or any simulation of such Industrial Property as part of the Agent's corporate or other trading name or designation of any kind.\n\n(g) Upon expiration or in the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Agent shall promptly discontinue every use of the Industrial Property and any language stating or suggesting the Agent is a distributor for Roundup Products.

The Agent shall not promote the sale of products using trademarks, packages or designs which are in Monsanto's opinion deceptively similar to Industrial Property.\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.15 Conflicts of Interest. Conflicts of interest relating to this Agreement are strictly prohibited. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither party nor any of its directors, employees or agents, or its subcontractors or vendors shall give to or receive from any director, employee or agent of the other party any gift, entertainment or other favor of significant value, or any commission, fee or rebate. Likewise, neither party nor its directors, employees or agents or its subcontractors or vendors shall, without prior written notification thereof to the other party, enter into any business relationship with any director, employee, or agent of the other party or any of its Affiliates unless such person is acting for and on behalf of such party. Each party shall promptly notify the other of any violation of this Section 6.15 and any consideration received as a result of such violation shall be paid over or credited to the other party.\n\nSection 6.16 Records Retention.

This obligation shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\nSection 6.17 Additional Covenant of the Agent. The Agent shall not take any action or fail to take any action that materially adversely impacts the Roundup brand or the Ag Market; provided, however, that the Agent shall have no liability for any event resulting primarily by an act or omission of Monsanto or its Affiliates.\n\nSection 6.18 Roundup Telephone Number.

Unless expressly agreed by the parties in writing on a country-by-country basis, Monsanto shall not sell, or promote the indirect sale of, the 1.67 Gallon Roundup Pro Max SKU through Lawn and Garden Channels in the Included Markets; provided, that the foregoing shall not be deemed an acknowledgement by Monsanto that a 1.67 Gallon package product or any other package size cannot have agricultural uses.\n\nARTICLE 7 - [RESERVED]\n\nARTICLE 8 - REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS\n\nSection 8.1 The Agent's Representations and Warranties.

The failure on the part of the Breaching Party to timely respond to the notice, and/or to timely appoint its arbitrator, shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of the arbitrator designated by the Claimant as the 'sole arbitrator.\n\n(3) If the Breaching Party appoints an arbitrator, then within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Breaching Party's response by the Claimant, the two arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. Upon their selection by either means, the three arbitrators (the \"Arbitrators\") shall expeditiously proceed to determine whether a Material Breach, Material Default or Material Willful Misconduct has occurred, in accordance with the procedures hereafter set forth.\n\n(4) Except as specifically modified herein, the arbitration proceeding contemplated by this section (the \"Arbitration\") shall be conducted in accordance with Title 9 of the US Code (United States Arbitration Act) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The cost of the Arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, with the understanding that the Arbitrators may reimburse the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the Arbitrators for that party's cost of the Arbitration in connection with the award made by the Arbitrators as described below.\n\n(5) The award shall be made within three (3) months after the appointment of the third Arbitrator, and each of the Arbitrators shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by the Arbitrators, if necessary.\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n(6) Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the written request of the other party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by the notice or the response, including those documents on which the producing party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the Arbitrators, which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed within 60 days following the appointment of the third Arbitrator.\n\n(7) At the request of a party, the Arbitrators shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition of witnesses to the extent the Arbitrators deem such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be held within 30 days of the making of a request, and shall be limited to a maximum of number of hours' duration as may be mutually agreed to by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement as may be determined by the Arbitrators. All objections are reserved for the arbitration hearing, except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information.\n\n(8) Either party may apply to the Arbitrators seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the controversy).\n\n(9) The scope of the Arbitration shall include the following:\n\n(i) a determination as to whether the act(s) or omission(s) set forth by the Claimant have occurred;\n\n(ii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be;\n\n(iii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be;\n\n(iv) a determination as to the amount of monetary damages, if any, suffered by the Claimant, as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, regardless of whether such act(s) or omission(s) rise to the level of Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be;\n\n(v) a determination, to the extent applicable, of the specific performance which could and should be decreed to correct any breach, fraud or material misconduct which the Arbitrators determine can be cured by the issuance of such decree;\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n(vi) a determination as to which party, if any, is the prevailing party in the Arbitration, and the amount of such party's costs and fees. \"Costs and fees\" means all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators' fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys' fees; and\n\n(vii) a determination as to such matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to carry out their duties in connection with the Arbitration.\n\n(10) The Arbitrators' award shall be in writing, shall be signed by a majority of the Arbitrators, and shall include a statement regarding the reasons for the disposition of any claim.\n\n(11) The Arbitrators' award shall, as applicable, include the following:\n\n(i) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the Claimant has suffered monetary damages as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, a monetary award in the amount of those damages;\n\n(ii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the harm resulting from those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred can be cured, in whole or in part by a decree of specific performance, such a decree of specific performance implementing such determination as can be submitted to and made the order of a Court of competent jurisdiction;\n\n(iii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be, an award authorizing the Claimant to immediately terminate this Agreement, together with damages or specific performance, if determined by the Arbitrators to be appropriate;\n\n(iv) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that there is a prevailing party, and that said prevailing party should receive an award of its Costs and Fees, such award to the prevailing party; and\n\n(v) such other matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to implement their determinations made in the Arbitration.\n\n(12) The written determination of the Arbitrators shall be made and delivered promptly to the parties to the Arbitration and shall be final and conclusive upon the parties to the Arbitration.\n\n(13) Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any Arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 10.5 Termination by the Agent.\n\n(a) Material Breach, Material Fraud and Material Willful Misconduct. The Agent may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) upon:\n\n(1) a Material Breach of this Agreement committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;\n\n(2) a Material Fraud committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;\n\n(3) Material Willful Misconduct committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement. Such termination shall take effect on the later of the first business day following the thirtieth (30th) day after the sending of a termination notice to Monsanto in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.9, or the date designated by the Agent in said termination notice.\n\n(b) Roundup Sale. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by written notice thereof to Monsanto upon receipt of notice of a Roundup Sale as described in Section 10.6.\n\n(c) Termination Fee. Upon termination of this Agreement by the Agent pursuant to Section 10.5(a), Monsanto shall pay to the Agent the Termination Fee applicable pursuant to the Table set forth in Section 10.4(d).\n\n(d) Brand Decline Event.\n\n(i) If prior to Program Year 2023\n\n(A) the Sell-Through Business has declined by more than twenty-five percent (25%) as compared to the Sell-Through Business for Program Year 2014 due to legal, regulatory, governmental or non-governmental organization actions adversely affecting the market for Roundup Products or due to diminished consumer or retailer acceptance of Roundup Products due to anti-Monsanto or anti-glyphosate sentiment, or\n\n(B) there has been a significant decline in the overall health and goodwill of the Roundup brand, as measured by industry standard market research and best practices such as attitude and usage studies (provided that the decline is not primarily due to the acts or omissions of the Agent or its Affiliates), and, in the case of (A) or (B),\n\n(C) such declines cannot be remedied by the end of the next full Program Year,\n\nthen the Agent may provide notice to Monsanto of such alleged declines (such declines, a \"Brand Decline Event\").\n\n(ii) If Monsanto does not contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\narbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice from the Agent, then that Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of such notice, and thereafter the Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent's sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement, which termination shall be effective at the end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers notice of termination pursuant to this Section 10.5(d)(ii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the Additional Commission Amount (in addition to the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional Commission Amount shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Commission, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 10.5(d).\n\n(iii) If Monsanto does contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice from the Agent, then the question of whether a Brand Decline Event has occurred will be finally determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement, and if a Brand Decline Event is finally determined to have occurred, then the Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of such notice, and thereafter the Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent's sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement, which termination shall be effective at the end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers notice of termination pursuant to this Section 10.5(d)(iii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the Additional Commission Amount (in addition to the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional Commission Amount shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Commission, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 10.5(d).\n\n[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) The amounts of the \"Additional Commission Amount\" mean, depending on the Program Year in which the Brand Decline Event occurs, the amounts indicated in the table below for the Program Years indicated:\n\nYear of Brand Decline Event => Program Year 2018 Program Year 2019 Program Year 2020 Program Year 2021 Program Year 2022\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2018 $10MM\n\n     Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2019 $10MM $10MM\n\n    Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2020 $10MM $10MM $10MM\n\n   Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2021 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM\n\n  Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2022 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2023 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2024 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2025\n\n\n\n$8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2026\n\n\n\n$6MM\n\nSection 10.6 Roundup Sale.\n\n(a) Roundup Sale Procedures.\n\n(i) Right of First Offer. If Monsanto (A) receives an unsolicited proposal with respect to a potential Roundup Sale and responds in any manner, other than rejecting such proposal, (B) solicits or makes a formal determination to solicit or make any proposal with respect to a potential Roundup Sale or (C) enters into an agreement relating to the provision of information with respect to a potential Roundup Sale (each a \"Roundup Sale Notice Trigger\"), the Agent shall have the rights as set forth in this Section 10.6 with respect to any such Roundup Sale and Monsanto shall promptly provide written notice to the Agent of such Roundup Sale as set forth\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\nin Section 10.6(a)(ii) (a \"Roundup Sale Notice\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 10.6(a) shall apply to any and all potential Roundup Sales.\n\n(ii) Roundup Sale Notice. Upon the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, Monsanto shall promptly provide a Roundup Sale Notice to the Agent along with all Roundup Offering Materials (subject to Monsanto entering into a confidentiality agreement on commercially reasonable terms with the Agent with respect to such Roundup Offering Materials). After the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, if Monsanto delivers any Roundup Offering Materials to a third party that contain material deviations from the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent, Monsanto shall provide copies of such Roundup Offering Materials to the Agent promptly after such delivery.\n\n(iii) Exclusivity.\n\n(A) For a period of sixty (60) days from the last date of receipt by the Agent of the Roundup Sale Notice and any related Roundup Offering Materials as set forth in Section 10.6(a)(ii) (the \"Exclusive Roundup Sale Period\"), Monsanto agrees to negotiate in good faith with the Agent on an exclusive basis with respect to any potential Roundup Sale. If and only if Monsanto has complied with the provisions of the preceding sentence and no definitive agreement has been entered into with the Agent or one of its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup Sale, then following the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period, Monsanto may then make solicitations to, or otherwise negotiate with, a third party or parties with respect to a Roundup Sale and may provide the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent to any such third party or parties in connection with a process to pursue a Roundup Sale. In the event that Monsanto engages in a process in which it seeks bids or proposals from more than one third party in connection with a contemplated Roundup Sale, the Agent shall be entitled to a fifteen (15) day exclusive negotiation period following the receipt and review by Monsanto of all bids or proposals (the \"Roundup Quiet Period\"), provided that, in determining the value of the price terms of the Agent's bid, Monsanto shall not discount the Agent's bid as a result of the fact that the Termination Fee is an offset or credit against the total purchase price, and that, during the Roundup Quiet Period, the Agent shall have the right to revise its original bid but shall not have the right to review the terms of any other bids or proposals. Monsanto may consummate a Roundup Sale with any third party only if such Roundup Sale is made pursuant to the acceptance by Monsanto of a Roundup Superior Offer.\n\n(B) During the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period, neither Monsanto nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly through its or their agents, employees or representatives or otherwise, solicit, or cause the solicitation of, or in any way encourage the making of, any offer, proposal or indication of interest involving a Roundup Sale or negotiate with, respond to any inquiry from (except for \"no comment\" or another statement agreed to by the Agent), cooperate with or furnish or cause or authorize to be furnished any information to, any third party or its agents, employees or representatives with respect thereto, or disclose to any third party that a Roundup Sale Notice has been provided to the Agent. Monsanto will immediately advise the Agent of any offer, proposal or indication of interest received by Monsanto or its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup Sale during the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period.\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Credit of Termination Fee. In the event that the Agent or any of its Affiliates acquires the Roundup Business in a Roundup Sale, the Termination Fee that would have been payable to the Agent upon a termination pursuant to Section 10.4(a) (2) shall be credited against the purchase price to be paid by the Agent or such Affiliate in the Roundup Sale.\n\n(c) Agent's Election. In the event that Monsanto determines to consummate a Roundup Sale with a party other than the Agent, Monsanto shall deliver the Agent notice thereof and of the identity of such other party. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the Agent shall deliver written notice to Monsanto stating either that:\n\n(1) The Agent intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(b), in which case such notice shall constitute a termination notice for purposes of this Agreement provided that the termination shall be effective at the end of the Third Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers its Notice of Termination pursuant to this provision; or\n\n(2) The Agent will not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(b) and agrees to continue the performance of its obligations under the Agreement unless and until the Agent receives a termination notice delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement by the successor to the Roundup Business.\n\n(d) Successor. Upon consummation of a Roundup Sale to a party other than the Agent, Monsanto's successor to the Roundup L&G Business shall assume all rights and responsibilities of Monsanto under this Agreement.\n\n(e) Noncompetition Upon Termination. In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Monsanto pursuant to Section 10.4(a)(2) hereof, or by the Agent pursuant to Section 10.6(c)(1) hereof, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.13 hereof, either party may, no earlier than three (3) years prior to the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, commence non- commercial activities (including formulation development, regulatory registrations, packaging and delivery systems development, and advertising and promotional material development and any other activities not prohibited by Section 6.13 of this Agreement during the Noncompetition Period, but excluding consumer-facing efforts or communications) for the sole purpose of such party's preparation to launch any competing product upon expiration of the Noncompetition Period; and provided, that either party may, no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, engage with retail customers for the sole purpose of selling-in competing products (provided that no product may be shipped to a retail customer or distributor prior to the end of the Noncompetition Period).\n\nSection 10.7 Effect of Termination.\n\n(a) Reserved.\n\n(b) Prior Obligations and Shipments. Termination shall not affect obligations of Monsanto or of the Agent which have arisen prior to the effective date of termination.\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Representations and Materials. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Agent shall not continue to represent itself as Monsanto's authorized agent to deal in Roundup Products, and shall remove, so far as practical, any printed material relating to such products from its salesperson's manuals and shall discontinue the use of any display material on or about the Agent's premises containing any reference to Roundup Products.\n\n(d) Return of Books, Records, and other Property. To the extent not otherwise provided herein, upon termination of this Agreement, the Agent shall immediately deliver to Monsanto all records, books, and other property of Monsanto.\n\nSection 10.8 Force Majeure. If either party is prevented or delayed in the performance of any of its obligations by force majeure and if such party gives written notice thereof to the other party within twenty (20) days of the first day of such event specifying the matters constituting force majeure, together with such evidence as it reasonably can give, then the party so prevented or delayed will be excused from the performance or punctual performance, as the case may be, as from the date of such notice for so long as such cause of prevention or delay continues. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term \"force majeure\" will be deemed to include an act of God, war, hostilities, riot, fire, explosion, accident, flood or sabotage; lack of adequate fuel, power, raw materials, containers or transportation for reasons beyond such party's reasonable control; labor trouble, strike, lockout or injunction (provided that neither party shall be required to settle a labor dispute against its own best judgment); compliance with governmental laws, regulations, or orders; breakage or failure of machinery or apparatus; or any other cause whether or not of the class or kind enumerated above, including, but not limited to, a severe economic decline or recession, which prevents or materially delays the performance of this Agreement in any material respect arising from or attributable to acts, events, non-happenings, omissions, or accidents beyond the reasonable control of the party affected.\n\nSection 10.9 [Intentionally deleted]\n\nARTICLE 11 - MISCELLANEOUS\n\nSection 11.1 Relationship of the Parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties' status with respect to each other shall be, at all times during the term of this Agreement, that of independent contractors retaining complete control over and complete responsibility for their respective operations and employees.

Nothing in this Agreement shall confer, or shall be construed to: (i) confer on the Agent any mutual proprietary interest in, or subject the Agent to any liability for, the business, assets, profits, losses, or obligations associated with Monsanto's manufacture, marketing, distribution and sales of Roundup Products; (ii) otherwise make either party a partner, member, or joint venturer of the other party (A) for purposes of the tax laws of the United States or any other country, or (B) for any other purposes under any other Laws; or (iii) create a franchise relationship between the parties. The parties expressly agree that at no time during the term of this Agreement, shall either party through its officers, directors, agents, employees, independent contractors or other representatives or through their respective representatives on the\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\nSteering Committee or Global Roundup Team take any action inconsistent with the foregoing expression of the nature of their relationship, except as required pursuant to applicable governmental authority under applicable Law or with the express written consent of the other party. Accordingly, the parties expressly agree to cooperate and communicate with the Steering Committee and the Global Roundup Support Team from time to time and in all events, annually, to ensure that both parties' actions are in compliance with this Section 11.1.\n\nSection 11.2 Interpretation in accordance with GAAP. The parties acknowledge that several terms and concepts (such as various financial and accounting terms and concepts) used or referred to herein are intended to have specific meanings and are intended to be applied in specific ways, but they are not so expressly and fully defined and explained in this Agreement. In order to supplement definitions and other provisions contained in this Agreement and to provide a means for interpreting undefined terms and applying certain concepts, the parties agree that, except as expressly provided herein, when costs are to be determined or other financial calculations are to be made, GAAP as well as the party's past accounting practices shall be used to interpret and determine such terms and to apply such concepts. For example, when actual costs and expenses are referred to herein, they are not intended to contain any margin or profit for the party incurring such costs or expenses.\n\nSection 11.3 Currency. All amounts payable and calculations under this Agreement shall be in United States dollars. As applicable, Program Sales Revenue, Program Expenses, Cost of Goods Sold, Service Costs, and Program EBIT shall be translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which United States dollars are listed in International Financial Statistics (publisher, International Monetary Fund) or if it is not available, The Wall Street Journal for the currency of the country in which the sales were made or the transactions occurred at the average rate of exchange for the Quarter in which such sales were made or transactions occurred.\n\nSection 11.4 Monsanto Obligations.

Subject to Section 6.10(g) of this Agreement, this Agreement, together with all respective exhibits and schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all representations, warranties, understandings, terms or conditions on such subjects that are not set forth herein or therein. Agreements on other subjects, such as security and other credit agreements or arrangements, shall remain in effect according to their terms. The parties recognize that, from time to time, purchase orders, bills of lading, delivery instructions, invoices and similar documentation will be transmitted by each party to the other to facilitate the implementation of this Agreement. Any terms and conditions contained in any of those documents which are inconsistent\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the terms of this Agreement shall be null, void and not enforceable. This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties hereto and is not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to each division or subsidiary of the Agent and Monsanto and either the Agent or Monsanto may seek enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement on behalf of or with respect to a particular subsidiary or division without changing the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement as to other aspects of the Agent's or Monsanto's business.\n\nSection 11.7 Modification and Waiver. No conditions, usage of trade, course of dealing, or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of the Agreement and no amendment to or modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any provision hereof, shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by each party hereto. No waiver by either Monsanto or the Agent, with respect to any default or breach or of any right or remedy, and no course of dealing shall be deemed to constitute a continuing waiver of any other breach or default or of any other right or remedy, unless such waiver be expressed in writing signed by the party to be bound.\n\n(a) The parties may, from time to time, enter into Commissionaire and Distributorship Agreements (\"Commissionaire Agreements\") in order to implement this Agreement on a local basis and/or to comply with local legal requirements and, unless a contrary intent is expressly set forth in the Commissionaire Agreements, the terms of the Commissionaire Agreements shall in no way modify, amend, replace or supersede any terms of this Agreement. The parties agree that Section 11.12(b) (but not Section 11.12(a)) of this Agreement shall apply to any dispute arising out of any such Commissionaire Agreements.\n\nSection 11.8 Assignment.\n\n(a) This Agreement and the various rights and obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.

Franchisor has a distinctive plan for the operation of retail outlets for the sale of fire-grilled food items and related products, which plan includes but is not limited to the El Pollo Loco® Marks and the Operations Manual (the \"Manual\"), policies, standards, procedures, employee uniforms, signs, menu boards and related items, and the reputation and goodwill of the El Pollo Loco® chain of restaurants (collectively, the \"El Pollo Loco® System\").\n\nB.Developer represents that it is experienced in and has independent knowledge of the nature and specifics of the restaurant business. Developer represents that in entering into this Agreement it has relied solely on its personal knowledge and has not relied on any representations of Franchisor or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, except those representations contained in any legally required Franchise Disclosure Document delivered to Developer.\n\nC.  Developer desires to obtain development rights for multiple restaurants under the El Pollo Loco® System (each, an \"El Pollo Loco® Restaurant\") from Franchisor within a specified geographical (the \"Territory\") specified in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof (or if single unit, replace with \"Developer desires to obtain development rights for a single restaurant under the El Pollo Loco® System (each, an \"El Pollo Loco® Restaurant\") from Franchisor within a specified address (the \"Territory\") specified in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\")\n\nD.Franchisor is willing to grant the (non-exclusive/exclusive) right to develop and open El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) within the Territory referenced in Exhibit \"A.\"\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and obligations herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n1.Development Rights in Territory.\n\n1.1. Franchisor hereby grants to Developer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (if Section 2.20 is applicable add \", and specifically Section 2.20 hereof,\") and as long as Developer shall not be in default of this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Developer and Franchisor, (non-exclusive/exclusive) development rights to establish and operate ____ franchised restaurant(s), and to use the El Pollo Loco® System solely in connection therewith, at specific locations to be designated in separate Franchise Agreement(s) (the \"Franchise Agreements\"). (If exclusive agreement, add \"Developer expressly acknowledges that the exclusive rights granted herein apply only to the right to develop new restaurants in the Territory, and no exclusive territory or radius protection for the term of any Franchise Agreement is granted herein and any such protection shall be set forth in the particular Franchise Agreement to be signed.\") The Franchise Agreements (and all ancillary documents attached as Exhibits to the Franchise Agreement, including the Personal Guarantee) executed in accordance with this Agreement shall be in the form currently in use by Franchisor at the time of execution of the Franchise Agreement and shall be executed individually by each person, partner, member or shareholder.\n\n1.2. (Only applies if exclusive Agreement. Delete if non-exclusive Agreement.) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.20 hereof, after the date of this\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement and during the term of this Agreement, and so long as Developer is in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, Franchisor shall neither, without Developer's prior written consent: (i) grant development rights to anyone else with respect to the Territory or any part of the Territory; nor (ii) establish or franchise any person to establish an El Pollo Loco restaurant under the Marks and System at any location within the Territory. Franchisor expressly retains all other rights and may, among other things, on any terms and conditions Franchisor deems advisable, and without granting Developer any rights therein:\n\na. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate an El Pollo Loco restaurant located outside of the Territory;\n\nb. Sell the same or similar products (whether or not using the Marks), as will be sold by Developer in a developed El Pollo Loco restaurant, to customers at any retail location (whether within or outside of the Territory), through any method or channel of distribution, including, without limitation, at retail locations such as grocery or convenience stores and via the Internet, telemarketing and direct marketing means, through other non-El-Pollo Loco restaurants having the same or similar menu items, or through any other distribution channel;\n\nc. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate restaurants (not using the Marks) having the same or similar menu items whether within or outside of the Territory; and\n\nd. Any continued operation by Franchisor, or the allowance of any continued operation by a franchisee of Franchisor, of an El Pollo Loco restaurant within the Territory which was opened on or before the date of this Agreement shall not be considered to constitute a breach of this Agreement.\n\n1.3. (Only applies to multi-unit Development Agreement - delete if single-unit Development Agreement). Prior to or concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Developer shall meet with Franchisor's development representatives and prepare a market development plan for the units to be constructed and opened by Developer in the Territory (identifying specific key areas, key intersections and trade areas in the Territory) and all development pursuant to this Agreement shall be in accordance with this plan (the \"Market Plan\"). The Market Plan shall include proposed areas where sites may be located, ranking and prioritization of site locations and other information customarily used by market planners in the restaurant industry. Developer and Franchisor shall jointly approve the Market Plan.\n\n2. Limitation on Development Rights.\n\n2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase agreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each calendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\n\n2.2. For purposes of the Development Schedule in Exhibit \"B\", no credit will be given for the development of El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) outside the Territory, regardless of the fact that Developer may, upon proper application, obtain from Franchisor an El Pollo Loco® Franchise Agreement (\"Franchise Agreement\") for any such development.\n\n2.3. Although this Agreement affords the Developer the right to develop and open El Pollo Loco® restaurant(s) within the Territory, as set forth on Exhibit \"A\", all Restaurant(s) developed under this Agreement must be duly licensed through individual Franchise Agreement(s). Developer will execute El Pollo Loco's then standard Franchise Agreement in use at the time of execution for each restaurant developed under this Agreement, and agrees to pay Franchisor the current fees, royalties and other required payments in accordance with the Franchise Agreement and Franchise Disclosure Document then in effect. Execution of the appropriate Franchise Agreement and payment of the initial franchise fee and/or any other required fees must be accomplished prior to the commencement of construction at any site.\n\n2.4. Developer must satisfy all Franchisor's financial and operational criteria then in effect and in addition, if Developer is also a Franchisee of one or more El Pollo Loco Restaurants, Franchisee must also be in good standing with Franchisor and satisfy all Franchisor's financial and operational criteria then in effect prior to El Pollo Loco's execution of each standard Franchise Agreement issued pursuant to this Agreement. Developer shall provide Franchisor with current information pertaining to Developer's financial condition and the financial condition of the majority and managing members/partners/shareholders of Developer at any time upon El Pollo Loco's request and in no event less than once annually. Developer acknowledges that, among other things, it will be\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nrequired to submit annual financial statements of Developer and personal financial statements of each of its principal owners and Managing Members to be eligible for financial approval by El Pollo Loco. In the event any of the majority owners of Developer shall also be the Managing Members and/or majority owners of any other entity which is a franchisee of El Pollo Loco, then each such franchisee entity must be operationally and financially approved by Franchisor before approval for expansion will be granted to any one franchisee entity. \"Managing Members\" shall be any individuals who are designated as the primary decision makers or general managers of the franchisee entity and those individuals who (individually or collectively) own at least 51% interest in the franchisee entity.\n\n2.5. Developer shall use its best efforts to retain qualified real estate professionals (including licensed brokers) to locate proposed sites for the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s). Developer shall submit proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant unit to be developed under this Agreement for acceptance by Franchisor's Real Estate Site Approval Committee (\"RESAC\"), together with such site information as may be reasonably required by Franchisor to evaluate the proposed site, no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as RESAC Submittal Dates, the first of which shall be approximately ninety (90) days after execution of this Agreement. Should the site be accepted by RESAC, it will be referred to as the \"Approved Site\". Such acceptance will expire one (1) year from the RESAC approval date. Franchisor may require, as a condition to its approval of a site, a \"Market Study\", which shall include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information and an analysis of the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants surrounding or within the vicinity of such proposed site all in such format as the Franchisor may require. All such analyses, information and studies shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Developer.\n\n2.6. Franchisor shall send representatives to evaluate proposed site(s) for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement, and Franchisor will do so at its own expense for the first two (2) proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant. If Developer proposes, and Franchisor evaluates, more than two (2) sites for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant, then Developer shall reimburse Franchisor for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Franchisor's representatives in connection with the evaluation of such additional proposed site(s), including, without limitation, the costs of lodging, travel, meals and wages.\n\n2.7. Provided there exists no default by Developer under this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Franchisor and Developer, Franchisor shall evaluate each site proposed for which Developer has provided all necessary evaluation information, and shall promptly after receipt of Developer's proposal, send to Developer written notice of acceptance or non-acceptance of the sit\n\n2.8. If RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may impact sales at any company-owned El Pollo Loco® Restaurant, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to accept or reject the proposed site, without any obligation to discuss a possible resolution with Developer. However, Franchisor may elect to discuss with Developer a possible resolution with regard to the proposed site; however, if such an agreement cannot be reached, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to reject the proposed site. If RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may potentially impact sales at any existing El Pollo Loco® franchisee's restaurant, Franchisor shall notify Developer of the existing El Pollo Loco® franchisees' location(s) and contact information. If nevertheless Developer wishes to try to proceed with that site, Developer must obtain a written waiver from those existing El Pollo Loco® franchisees of any claims they might have against Developer and Franchisor with respect to the proposed new El Pollo Loco® Restaurant. Such waiver, if obtained, must be submitted along with the evaluation information required pursuant to this Section.\n\n2.9. No later than the Site Commitment Dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\", Developer shall submit for the Approved Site to Franchisor for its review and approval of:\n\na. A fully negotiated but unexecuted lease, which may only subject to obtaining necessary governmental permits. The unexecuted form of the lease must be submitted to Franchisor to review for the required terms and conditions listed in Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below prior to full execution of the lease. Franchisor will promptly notify Developer upon their approval of the inclusion of such required terms and conditions. Developer will promptly then provide a final executed copy of the lease to Franchisor; or\n\nb. A purchase agreement. Should Developer purchase the site using another entity other than the franchise entity, Developer must then enter into a lease with the Franchise entity as the lessee and the purchasing entity as the lessor and must comply with all the requirements of this Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below).\n\n2.10. Any lease to be entered into by Developer shall include the terms and conditions set forth below and in a form approved by Franchisor:\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\na. The tenant entity on the lease must match the franchise entity on the franchise agreement; and\n\nb. The term (with renewal options) of the lease must match at least the initial term of the franchise agreement; and\n\nc. The landlord consents to your use of the premises as an El Pollo Loco® restaurant which will be open during the required days and hours set out in the Operations Manual.\n\n2.11. Franchisor shall have no liability under any lease or purchase agreement for any El Pollo Loco® Restaurant location developed under this Agreement and shall not guarantee Developer's obligations thereunder. Upon approval by Franchisor of the form of Developer's lease and execution of a lease for a site by Developer, Developer shall furnish to Franchisor a fully executed copy of such lease and any amendments thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days of such execution. Franchisor shall have no obligation to assist Developer to negotiate its leases.\n\n2.12. The lease or deed may not contain a non-competition covenant which restricts Franchisor or any franchisee or licensee of Franchisor, from operating an El Pollo Loco® Restaurant or any other retail restaurant, unless such covenant is approved by Franchisor in writing prior to the execution by Developer of the lease.\n\n2.13. Each subsequent site to be developed pursuant to the Development Schedule shall be submitted for approval by RESAC by the date set forth in Exhibit \"B\". Similarly, each fully executed lease (executed upon prior review and approval by Franchisor) or purchase agreement (with all contingencies to Developer's obligations waived or satisfied, except permitting contingencies) relating to each subsequent Approved Site shall: (1) be delivered to Franchisor on or before the Site Commitment Date for each respective El Pollo Loco® Restaurant as set forth in Exhibit \"B\" and (2) prior to the execution of your Franchise Agreements (3) prior to the payment of your initial Franchise Fees for each site and (4) prior to the commencement of construction of the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant.\n\n2.14. RESAC site approval does not assure that a Franchise Agreement will be executed. Execution of the Franchise Agreement is contingent upon Developer completing the purchase or lease of the proposed site within sixty (60) days after approval of the site by the Franchisor or no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as Site Committment Dates.\n\n2.15. Developer acknowledges that time is of the essence in this Agreement. If Developer has not obtained approval and entered into a binding lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s) to be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer shall be in default of its obligations under the Development Schedule and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement, up to and including termination of this Agreement.\n\n2.16. Developer also acknowledges that it is required pursuant to this Agreement to open El Pollo Loco® Restaurants in the future pursuant to dates set forth in the Development Schedule attached as Exhibit \"B\". If Developer fails to meet the opening date for any El Pollo Loco® Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement, Developer shall be in default and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies available to Franchisor set forth in Section 11. Developer acknowledges that if Developer fails to open El Pollo Loco® Restaurants in a timely manner pursuant to the Development Schedule, Franchisor will suffer lost revenues, including royalties and other fees which would be difficult to calculate and which Franchisor would have received had Developer met the agreed schedule or had Franchisor had the right to grant development rights to others in the Territory.\n\n2.17. Developer acknowledges that the estimated initial investment and estimated expenses set forth in Items 6 and 7 of our Franchise Disclosure Document are subject to and likely to increase over time, and that future El Pollo Loco® Restaurants will likely involve a greater initial investment and operating capital requirements than those stated in the Franchise Disclosure Document provided to you prior to your execution of this Agreement.\n\n2.18. Developer understands and acknowledges that in accepting Developer's proposed site or by granting a franchise for each approved site, Franchisor does not in any way, endorse, warrant or guarantee either directly or indirectly the suitability of such site or the success of the franchise business to be operated by Developer at such site. The suitability of the site and the success of the franchise business depend upon a number of factors outside of Franchisor's control, including, but not limited to, the Developer's operational abilities, site location, consumer trends and such other factors that are within the direct control of the Developer. Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n2.19. The purpose of this Agreement is to promote orderly incremental growth within the El Pollo Loco® System. The acquisition of existing El Pollo Loco® restaurants by Developer does not represent incremental growth and, therefore, does not satisfy the terms of this Agreement pertaining to development.\n\n2.20. (To be added where there are existing restaurants in the Territory) Developer acknowledges that Franchisor (i) is operating or has franchised another to operate, one (1) or more restaurants in the Territory or (ii) has granted franchise rights to another in the Territory or (iii) approved a new site for development for those locations identified in Exhibit \"C\" attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Developer further acknowledges that Franchisor retains the sole and absolute right to approve or disapprove any proposed location for development under this Agreement if, in Franchisor's reasonable judgment: (i) such proposed location is not suitable for an El Pollo Loco® Restaurant or (ii) such proposed location will have a material adverse effect on the profitability of another existing El Pollo Loco® location (or approved site) in the Territory. Developer covenants to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid selecting proposed locations that would adversely impact pre-existing locations in the Territory.\n\n3. Development Fee.\n\n3.1. Developer shall pay to Franchisor upon execution of this Agreement a non-refundable Development Fee (the \"Development Fee\") equal to Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) in immediately available funds, for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement. The Development Fee is consideration for this Agreement. The Development Fee is not consideration for any Franchise Agreement and is non-refundable. The $20,000 Development Fee for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant shall be applied against the initial franchise fee payable upon the execution of the Franchise Agreement applicable to such El Pollo Loco® Restaurant. As a benefit of signing the Development Agreement, the Initial Fee for the second and each subsequent restaurant developed under the same Development Agreement will be reduced by us to $30,000. As an example, the Initial Fee for the first restaurant developed under a Development Agreement would be $40,000 to which $20,000 (from the Development Fee will be credited. The Initial Fee for the second and remaining restaurants developed under the same Development Agreement would be $30,000, to which $20,000 from the Development Fee will be credited. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10 or 11 below, Developer will lose its right to develop and Development Fee.\n\n4. Term of Development Agreement.\n\n4.1. This Agreement shall commence on the date specified in Exhibit \"B\". Unless terminated pursuant to Section 10 or 11 below, it shall expire upon the earlier of the date specified in Exhibit \"B\" or upon the opening of the last El Pollo Loco® Restaurant listed in the Development Schedule.\n\n5. Territory Conflicts.\n\n5.1. The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other franchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development agreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial rights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For this purpose, Franchisor agrees to approve any such assignment not in conflict with the other terms of this Agreement, subject to the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, and current policies pertaining to assignments, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of all past due debts owed to Franchisor and the execution of a General Release.\n\n5.2. In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El Pollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the development of the Territory. However, if it appears to El Pollo Loco, as its sole and absolute right to determine, that protection of the Territory by legal action is not advisable, whether due to the anticipation of, or the actual protracted nature of the action, the costs involved, the uncertainty of outcome, or otherwise, Franchisor has the right to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance, if any, of the Development Fee made pursuant to Section 3, which has not been applied against the initial franchise fees for Franchise Agreement(s) to be acquired under this Agreement.\n\n6. Proprietary Rights of El Pollo Loco. Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1. Developer expressly acknowledges El Pollo Loco's exclusive right, title, and interest in an to the trade name, service mark and trademark \"El Pollo Loco\", and such other trade names, service marks, and trademarks which are designated as part of the El Pollo Loco® System (the \"Marks\"), and Developer agrees not to represent in any manner that Developer has any ownership in El Pollo Loco® Marks. This Agreement is not a Franchise Agreement. Developer may not open an El Pollo Loco® Restaurant or use the El Pollo Loco® Marks at a particular site until it executes a Franchise Agreement for that site. Developer's use of the El Pollo Loco® Marks shall be limited to those rights granted under each individual Franchise Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, El Pollo Loco® may authorize Developer in writing to use the Marks in connection with advertising and marketing activities in connection with this Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that such usage is limited to those specific activities or promotional materials approved by El Pollo Loco's marketing department in advance. Developer further agrees that its use of the Marks shall not create in its favor any right, title, or interest in or to El Pollo Loco® Marks, but that all of such use shall inure to the benefit of El Pollo Loco, and Developer has no rights to the Marks except to the degree specifically granted by the individual Franchise Agreement(s). Building designs and specifications, color schemes and combinations, sign design specifications, and interior building layouts (including equipment, equipment specification, equipment layouts, and interior color schemes and combinations) are acknowledged by Developer to comprise part of the El Pollo Loco® System. Developer shall have no right to license or franchise others to use the Marks by virtue of this Agreement.\n\n6.2. Developer acknowledges that, in connection with its execution of this Agreement, it may receive confidential and proprietary information regarding the El Pollo Loco® System, including but not limited to the El Pollo Loco Operational Manual. Developer recognizes the unique value and secondary meaning attached to the El Pollo Loco® Marks and the El Pollo Loco® System, and Developer agrees that any noncompliance with the terms of this Agreement or any unauthorized or improper use will cause irreparable damage to Franchisor and its franchisees. Developer, therefore, agrees that if it should engage in any such unauthorized or improper use during, or after, the term of this Agreement, Franchisor shall be entitled to both seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in addition to any other remedies prescribed by law.\n\n6.3. Developer acknowledges that it will receive one (1) copy of the Operations Manual on loan from Franchisor and that the Operations Manual shall at all times remain the sole property of the Franchisor.\n\n7. Insurance and Indemnification.\n\n7.1. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for public liability, including products liability, in the amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.\n\n7.2. Franchisor shall be named as an additional insured on all such insurance policies and shall be provided with certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage. All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days' notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.\n\n7.3. Franchisor reserves the right to specify reasonable changes in the types and amounts of insurance coverage required by this Section 7. In the event that Developer fails or refuses to obtain or maintain the required insurance coverage from an insurance carrier acceptable to El Pollo Loco, Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right and without any obligations to do so, procure such coverage for Developer. In such event, Developer shall pay the required premiums or reimburse such premiums to Franchisor upon written demand.\n\n7.4. Developer shall defend immediately upon tender of defense, at its own cost, the Franchisor, its subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this section only known as \"Franchisor\"), from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitrations, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liens and damages (collectively for this section only known as \"Losses\"), however caused, and reimburse Franchisor for all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Franchisor in defense of any Losses, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of, or alleged to arise out of, or in connection with Developer's activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee's training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer's failure for\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nany reason to fully inform any third party of Developer's lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees that Developer's duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of Developer's duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer's negligence, breach of contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer's duty to defend is regardless of the outcome of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liens or damages.\n\n7.5. Developer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Franchisor (as defined above) from and against any and all Losses (as defined above), however caused, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of or in connection with Developer's activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee's training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer's failure for any reason to fully inform any third party of Developer's lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from latent or other defects in the restaurant whether or not discoverable by Franchisor, and those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Franchisor from all said Losses and shall pay for and be responsible for all said Losses, however caused, whether by any individual, employee, third person or party, vendor, visitor, invitee, trespasser or any firm or corporation whatsoever, whether caused by or contributed to by Franchisor, the combined conduct of Developer and Franchisor, or active or passive negligence of Franchisor, but for the sole negligence or willful misconduct of Franchisor.\n\n7.6. The provisions of this Section 7 shall expire as to each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement upon execution of a Franchise Agreement for such El Pollo Loco® Restaurant. The provision of the Franchise Agreement, in particular, Section 9 thereof (insurance and Indemnification) shall supersede this Section 7 and govern the rights and obligations of the parties prospectively.\n\n8. Transfer of Rights.\n\n8.1. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Franchisor and its successors and assigns, and is fully assignable by El Pollo Loco.\n\n8.2. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is personal in nature with respect to Developer, being entered into by Franchisor in reliance upon and in consideration of the personal skills, qualifications and trust and confidence reposed in Developer and Developer's present partners, managing members or officers if Developer is a partnership, a limited liability company or a corporation. Therefore, the rights, privileges and interests of Developer under this Agreement shall not be assigned, sold, transferred, leased, divided or encumbered, voluntarily or involuntarily, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of El Pollo Loco, which consent may be given or withheld as El Pollo Loco's sole and absolute right. For purposes of this Section, a sale of stock, or any membership or partnership interest in Developer, or a merger or other combination of Developer shall be considered a transfer of Developer's interest prohibited hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall be permitted to assign business organizations to serve as Franchisee after Developer individually executes the Franchise Agreements, provided the ownership mirrors that of Developer (e.g., Developer consists of persons A (50%), B (25%) and C (25%). Franchisee also must be owned and controlled by the same three (3) persons with each retaining the same percentage of ownership). All other entity structures shall require the prior written approval of Franchisor. Developer shall pay an administrative fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per transfer for each permitted transfer to an Entity where such transfer is for the convenience of ownership only and does not involve a change of principals of the business. Where Developer desires to add new principals to the Developer or any Franchisee entity, Developer shall pay to Franchisor an additional Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) per new principal to cover Franchisor's administrative costs for reviewing the application and suitability of each new principal as participants in the franchise business.\n\n9.

Franchisor reserves the right to approve or disapprove any Transfer as its sole and absolute right.\n\n11.3. If Franchisor is entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Sections 11.1 or 11.2 above, Franchisor shall have the right to undertake the following action instead of terminating this Agreement:\n\na. Franchisor may terminate or modify any rights that Developer may have with respect to protected exclusive rights in the Territory, as granted under Section 1.1 above, effective ten (10) days after delivery of written notice thereof to Developer.\n\n11.4.

Non-Waiver.\n\n13.1. El Pollo Loco's consent to or approval of any act or conduct of Developer requiring such consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary El Pollo Loco's consent to or approval of any subsequent act or conduct hereunder.\n\n14. Independent Contractor and Indemnification.\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14.1. This Agreement does not constitute Developer an agent, legal representative, joint venturer, partner, employee or servant of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever, and it is understood between the parties hereto that Developer shall be an independent contractor and is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty or representation on behalf of El Pollo Loco.

Severability.\n\n17.1. Each section, part, term and/or provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable, and if, for any reason, any section, part, term and/or provision herein is determined to be invalid, contrary to, or in conflict with, any existing or future law or regulation, by any court or agency having valid jurisdiction, then such shall be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement, but such shall not impair the operation of, or affect the remaining portions, sections, parts, terms and/or provisions of this Agreement, which will continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties hereto.\n\n18. Applicable Law; Choice of Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial.\n\n18.1. This Agreement, after review by Developer and El Pollo Loco, was accepted in the state in which Franchisor's then-current headquarters (currently the State of California) is located and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of such state, except that the provisions in Section 20.1 covering competition following the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state in which the breach occurs. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY COURT, WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE, WILL BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE STATE IN WHICH FRANCHISOR'S HEADQUARTERS (CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA) IS THEN LOCATED. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO DEMAND OR HAVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE FRANCHISOR IS A PARTY.

ANY ACTION BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND FRANCHISOR SHALL INVOLVE ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS OF DEVELOPER AND SHALL NOT INVOLVE ANY CLASS, GROUP, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR ASSOCIATIONAL ACTION. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 18.1 IS INTENDED BY THE PARTIES TO SUBJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY FRANCHISE OR SIMILAR LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO WHICH THIS AGREEMENT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT.\n\n19. Document Interpretation.\n\n19.1. All terms and words used in this Agreement, regardless of the number and gender in which they are used, shall be deemed and construed to include the singular or plural tense, and any gender, whether masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context or sense of this Agreement or any paragraph or clause may require, the same as if such words had been fully and properly written in the appropriate number or gender. In the event of a conflict in the language, terms, or conditions between this Agreement and any Franchise Agreement issued pursuant to this Agreement, the Franchise Agreement shall control.\n\n20. Covenant Not to Compete.\n\n20.1. To further protect the El Pollo Loco® System while this Agreement is in effect, Developer and each officer, director, shareholder, member, manager, partner and other equity owner, as applicable, of Developer, if Developer is an entity, shall neither directly nor indirectly own, operate, control or any financial interest in any other business which would constitute a \"Competitive Business\" (as hereinafter defined) without the prior written consent of Franchisor; provided further, that Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right, consent to the Developer's continued operation of any business already in existence and operating at the time of execution of this Agreement. In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor, Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory.

In the event that any provision of Section 20.1 above shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall not be void, but such provision shall be limited to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\n20.3. Developer understands and acknowledges that Franchisor shall have the right to reduce the scope of any obligation imposed on Developer by Section 20.1, without Developer's consent, and that such modified provision shall be effective upon Developer's receipt of written notice thereof.\n\n20.4. Developer acknowledges that violation of the covenants not to compete contained in this Agreement would result in immediate and irreparable injury to Franchisor for which no adequate remedy at law will be available. Accordingly, Developer hereby consents to the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting any conduct by Developer in violation of the terms of those covenants not to compete set forth in this Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that it may conclusively be presumed that any violation of the terms of said covenants not to compete was accomplished by and through Developer's unlawful utilization of Franchisor's Confidential Information, know-how, methods and procedures\n\n21.

Accounting Provisions. The Joint Venturers shall maintain adequate books      and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs      conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All direct costs and      expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the      distribution of the Products or operations of the Joint Venture, or if the      business of the Joint Venture requires additional office facilities than      those now presently maintained by each Joint Venturer, such item shall be\n\n\n\n\n\n     paid by the Joint Venture.

Distributions. During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be      allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint      Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any      part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property      of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided,      however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to      time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be      needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint      Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution      is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the      Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint      Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown      in Section 6.\n\n10.  Internal Revenue Code Election. The Joint Venturers agree and declare that      this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation      does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or      United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is      willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the      operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party      elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code      of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded      from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1      of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out      of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary,      be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate      documentation. The Parties also declare that they are not making any      agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this      Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation      of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business      for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with      each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the      performance of their joint venture business operation.\n\n11.  Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to      the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint      Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers      ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set      forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.\n\n12.  Sale or Purchase of Interest of Joint Venturer Prohibited. No Joint      Venturer shall be authorized or empowered to mortgage, hypothecate, pledge,      sell, or transfer, an interest in the Joint Venture, nor confer on any      successor or assignee the right to become a Joint Venturer without the      consent of the other Joint Venturer.\n\n13.  Notice. Any notice which a Joint Venturer shall have occasion to give to      the other Joint Venturer shall be deemed sufficient notice for all purposes      as to its contents if given in writing, hand delivered, by fax, or prepaid      mail, to the address of such Joint Venturer as set out below his signature.\n\n14.  Construction. The Joint Venturers declare that in entering into this      Agreement, they have contracted with reference to the laws of the      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the construction and interpretation of      the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and      construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, except in      such cases and to such extent as the laws of another jurisdiction shall      necessarily control.\n\n15.  Benefit. This Agreement shall be binding on the Joint Venturers and their      respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators, and assigns.\n\n16.  Counterparts.

PAYMENT AND ACCOUNTING.\n\n6.1. Payment Terms and Reports. Payments due under Section 2.2 shall be payable to PcoMed by Integra on a quarterly basis within 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter. Each such payment shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the number and type of Treated Integra Product and Partially Treated Integra Product sold and the Net Sales applicable thereto, (ii) a breakdown of all the components of Net Sales for the determination of payments due under Sections 2.2 (the numbers may be and type of products may be stated in the aggregate and not by customer and are not required to be detailed by geographic area unless Fee rates are different in different geographic areas). Treated Integra Product and/or Partially Treated Integra Product shall be considered as being sold for the purpose of the calculation of payments due under Sections 2.2 when the payments for the Treated Integra Product and/or Partially Treated Integra Product are received by Integra or its Affiliates from a Third Party. All payments to be made under this Agreement shall be paid in United States dollars. Net Sales of Treated Integra Product and/or Partially Treated Integra Product and fees in currencies other than United States dollars shall be first determined in the currency of the country in which they are earned and shall be converted (for the purpose of calculation only) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial reporting in the United States.\n\n6.2. Records and Audits. Integra shall keep and maintain accurate records and documentation pertaining to Net Sales of Treated Integra Product in sufficient detail to permit PcoMed to calculate payments due hereunder. Integra shall retain such records and documentation for a period that is consistent with its Records Retention Policy. Such records and documentation will be available for inspection during such period by an independent certified public accountant selected by PcoMed and reasonably acceptable to Integra, solely for the purpose of verifying the payments made by Integra under this Agreement. Said accountant shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with Integra and shall not disclose to PcoMed any information except that which is necessary to determine whether PcoMed has received all amounts due to it from Integra. Such inspections shall be made no more than once each calendar year during ordinary business hours and on reasonable prior notice and shall be at PcoMed's sole cost and expense. PcoMed shall report the results of any such audit to Integra within 60 days of completion and provide a copy of such audit 11\n\n\n\n\n\nto Integra. The results of any such audit shall be the Confidential Information of Integra. To the extent that such audit reveals any underpayments by Integra, Integra shall pay to PcoMed the amount of shortfall within 60 days from the date on which the parties actually agreed on the amount of the shortfall, or, in the event the parties do not reach agreement on the shortfall, the date a court issues a judgment finally resolving the matter.\n\n6.3. Taxes. PcoMed shall pay any and all taxes levied on account of payments it receives under this Agreement. Integra shall pay, or cause to be paid, any and all taxes required to be paid or withheld on any Sales, supply or other transfers for value of Treated Integra Product and/or Partially Treated Integra Product (other than taxes imposed on the income or revenues of PcoMed). All amounts due hereunder shall be without deduction of exchange, collection or other charges, provided that if Integra is required to withhold and pay on behalf of PcoMed any income or other similar tax with respect to the amounts payable under this Agreement, Integra shall deduct such tax payments from and offset against any said payments prior to remittance to PcoMed; and further provided that in regard to any tax so deducted, Integra shall give to PcoMed such assistance as may reasonably be necessary to enable PcoMed to claim exemption therefrom and credit therefor, and in each case shall furnish PcoMed proper evidence of the taxes paid on PcoMed's behalf, provided that Integra shall not be required to incur any out-of-pocket expenses or costs. 7.

Each term used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Offer.     RECITALS     WHEREAS, Purchaser is tentatively exploring, among other potential alternatives, a possible third-party tender offer to purchase all  outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share (\"Shares\"), of a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\") upon the terms and  subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, related Letter of Transmittal, and other tender offer material provided by or on behalf of  Purchaser to the Sponsors (which, collectively, as amended or supplemented, constitute the \"Offer\");     WHEREAS, as requested by Purchaser for purposes of the Offer, each Sponsor has provided to Purchaser, and Purchaser has accepted  from such Sponsor, a commitment letter providing for a possible equity investment in Purchaser by such Sponsor (each, an \"Equity Commitment Letter\" and, with respect to any Sponsor(s), the Equity Commitment Letter(s) of such Sponsor(s)), which evidences the commitment of and by  such Sponsor to contribute capital to Purchaser in amounts and proportions and upon the terms and subject to the conditions and otherwise as  contemplated by such Equity Commitment Letter (each, a \"Commitment\" and, with respect to any Sponsor(s), the Commitment of such Sponsor (s));     WHEREAS, such capital contributions, if any, would be used to purchase Shares in the Offer and fund the payment or reimbursement of  fees, expenses, and costs related to the Offer (collectively, \"Transaction Costs\"); and     WHEREAS, each party hereto desires to establish certain terms and conditions related to the Offer and relationship among the Sponsors,  the related equity financing commitments, and the Offer;     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each party  hereto (\"Party\"), intending to be legally bound, hereby agrees as follows:     AGREEMENT     1. Pre-Acceptance Period. If and to the extent any such decision would or could (or would or could be reasonably foreseeable to)  adversely affect any Sponsor in any manner, each decision to be made by or on behalf of Purchaser with respect to the Offer (or any similar  transaction), any agreements related thereto (\"Related Agreements\"), or any transaction contemplated by the Offer or any Related Agreement  (\"Contemplated Transactions\" and, together with the Offer and Related Agreements, \"Offer Matters\"), or any Offer Matter or combination of  Offer Matters, in any case, on and from the Effective Date and until the Acceptance Time (\"Pre-Acceptance Period\") shall require the unanimous  consent of the Sponsors, including, without limitation, any (a) announcement of intention, commencement, amendment, supplement, termination,  extension, modification, or waiver of or related to the Offer or any term or condition thereof, including, without limitation, with respect to any  commencement date, initial offering period, offer price, type or form of consideration to be offered or paid, timing or other term of acceptance for  payment or payment of any subject security, withdrawal right, expiration date, subsequent offering period, or top-up option, (b) waiver of any  condition to or of the Offer or determination as to whether or not any such condition has been, is, or will be satisfied, (c) filing, dissemination, or  disclosure requirement or offering document or tender offer material, including, without limitation, with respect to any filing or exhibit, schedule,  attachment, amendment, or supplement thereto, (d) agreement, instrument, document, or matter related to any borrowing, incurrence of  indebtedness, or equity, debt, or other financing, (e) litigation or other legal proceeding, including, without limitation, with respect to any  stockholder list or security holder listing or poison pill, rights plan, or similar right, or derivative or other litigation or legal proceeding related to the  Company's capitalization, (f) designation, nomination, appointment, or election of any person as a member of the board of directors of the  Company, or (g) agreement, arrangement, or understanding with the Company or any manager, director, officer, employee, stockholder, partner,  affiliate, associate, or related party of the Company.\n\nTender Offer Statement on Schedule TO - July 16, 2012 Exhibit (d)(i)  Sponsorship Agreement - July 16, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      2. Equity Commitments. Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor is bound by and has complied with,  and agrees that such Sponsor shall continue to be bound by and comply with, the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other  than any Defaulting Sponsor) shall be entitled to enforce, or direct the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this  Agreement if and only if the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have determined by unanimous written consent that the conditions of  the Offer have been satisfied or to waive all such conditions remaining unsatisfied. No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).     3. Defaulting and Participating Sponsors. Each Sponsor that has complied with the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement  (\"Participating Sponsor\") may terminate the participation in the Offer of any Sponsor that has not satisfied the funding requirements contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise failed to comply with the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement (\"Defaulting  Sponsor\"); provided, however, that such termination shall not affect any right of any Participating Sponsor as against such Defaulting Sponsor  with respect to such failure to fund or any such other non-compliance. If the Participating Sponsors unanimously consent to proceed (and whether  or not any Participating Sponsor elects to seek specific performance as against any Defaulting Sponsor in connection herewith), the amount of the  commitment of each Defaulting Sponsor shall be offered, first, to the Participating Sponsors pro rata (based on the commitments of such  Participating Sponsors), and, thereafter, as applicable, to one or more other co-investors, unanimously approved by the Participating Sponsors.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the time any Sponsor becomes a Defaulting Sponsor, the approval or consent of  such Defaulting Sponsor shall not be required for any purpose hereunder; provided,  however, that each Defaulting Sponsor that ultimately  participates in the Offer (as a result of any Participating Sponsor electing to seek specific performance as against such Defaulting Sponsor) shall  cease to be a \"Defaulting Sponsor\" and shall have approval and consent rights hereunder.     4. Transfer Restrictions. During the Pre-Acceptance Period, no Sponsor shall transfer any portion of the Commitment or any interest in  Purchaser (\"Unit\") other than to any investment fund affiliated with such Sponsor; provided, however, that no such transfer shall relieve such  Sponsor of any corresponding or other portion of any obligation of such Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter or hereunder unless and  until such fund: (a) has committed equity or similar available capital in amounts sufficient to satisfy such obligation; (b) executes and delivers to  Purchaser an appropriate equity commitment letter, a joinder signature page to this Agreement, and each other document reasonably requested by  Purchaser (collectively, the \"New Sponsor Documents\") and agrees to be bound hereby as a \"Sponsor\" hereunder; (c) certifies to each Party that  such fund is capable of performing the obligations of such fund under each such New Sponsor Document; and (d) is approved by each non- transferring Participating Sponsor, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.     5. Interim Period and Continuing Sponsors. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into at or prior to  the Acceptance Time: (a) an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Purchaser (\"Purchaser LLC Agreement\"); and (b) one  or more definitive agreements with the Participating Sponsors (collectively, \"Security Holder Agreements\") providing for the unanimous consent  of the Continuing Sponsors with respect to all decisions to be made by or on behalf of Purchaser with respect to any Offer Matter or the Company  or any security issued or to be issued by the Company during the period on and from the Acceptance Date and until the time there ceases to be at  least two Continuing Sponsors (\"Interim Period\"), including without limitation, any matter described in or contemplated by Section 1 hereof. For  purposes hereof, \"Continuing Sponsor\" shall mean and refer to each Participating Sponsor that becomes a member of Purchaser and a party to the  Purchaser LLC Agreement and Security Holder Agreements (collectively, the \"Management-Ownership Agreements\"), in each case, as long as  such Sponsor continues to be a member of Purchaser and comply with the Management-Ownership Agreements.     6. Voting Agreements. Purchaser shall (and each Sponsor shall cause each Unit owned by such Sponsor, if any, to be voted to cause  Purchaser to) authorize, issue, sell, or exchange, as applicable, Units to Participating Sponsors pro rata (based on the Commitments of Participating  Sponsors) and otherwise in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters and this Agreement; provided, however, that each Unit of any class or  series shall be issued at the same price(s) and in the same proportion(s) as all other Units of such class or series.\n\n\n\nTender Offer Statement on Schedule TO - July 16, 2012 Exhibit (d)(i)  Sponsorship Agreement - July 16, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      7. Distribution, Redemption, and Other Transfer Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Management-Ownership Agreement  to the contrary, each Continuing Sponsor may, at any time or from time to time in such Sponsor's sole discretion, cause Purchaser to distribute or  otherwise transfer to such Sponsor all (but not less than all) of the amount of the Shares, if any, then owned by Purchaser equal to such Sponsor's  pro rata share thereof (based on the Units then owned by all Sponsors) in redemption of or otherwise in exchange and as consideration for the  Units then owned by such Sponsor.     8. Termination Fee. An amount equal to any termination or similar fee received by Purchaser, including, without limitation, any such fee  paid by the Company or any affiliate, associate, or related party of the Company pursuant to a merger agreement or otherwise, or portion thereof  remaining after making or confirming adequate provisions for the payment or reimbursement of Transaction Costs, shall be promptly distributed or  otherwise paid to the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) or their designees, in any case, pro rata (based on the Commitments or Units  of such Sponsors, as applicable).     9. Expenses. To the extent Purchaser has available funds, Purchaser shall promptly pay or reimburse, as applicable, all Transaction Costs  incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser or the Sponsors in connection with the Offer as follows: (a) first, all such Transaction Costs reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser, including, without limitation, in connection with the formation or organization of Purchaser; and (b) second,  all such Transaction Costs reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Sponsors in connection with the Offer, which shall be paid or reimbursed pro  rata (based on the Commitments or Units of such Sponsors, as applicable). Except as otherwise expressly provided hereby and to the extent  Purchaser does not have available funds, each Sponsor shall be responsible for any and all fees, expenses, and other costs incurred by or on  behalf of such Sponsor.     10. Disclosures; Legal Compliance. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each other Party that: (a) in  connection with the Offer and this Agreement, such Party has not made, and shall not make, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (b)  all information provided by or on behalf of such Party to any other Party for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Schedule TO or other  filing with the Commission or any other tender offer material (\"Provided Information\") was, when provided, true, accurate, correct, and complete in  all material respects; provided further, that such Sponsor shall cause such Provided Information and such filing and material, as applicable, to be  amended and supplemented, in each case, as required by law and otherwise promptly and as necessary and appropriate to make the Provided  Information and such filing and material, as applicable, true, accurate, correct, and complete in all material respects; (c) such Party shall not (and  shall cause each related party of such Party not to) take any action or omit to take any action that would violate, or cause Purchaser to be deemed  in violation of, any securities or other law applicable to the Offer, including, without limitation, (i) the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended (\"Exchange Act\"), or Rule 14e-5 thereunder or (ii) with respect to tendering any security of the Company in the Offer or paying any  consideration to, or entering into any contract, agreement, or arrangement with, any party in connection with or related to the Offer in violation of  Rule 14d-10 under the Exchange Act; and (d) such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other Party to establish  protocols to ensure compliance with this Section.     11. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate at and as of (the first to occur of): (a) 12:00 midnight, New York City time,  on the 30th day after the Effective Date (if Purchaser has not commenced the Offer, with the unanimous consent of the Sponsors, by then); (b) the  expiration of the Offer (if the Offer is not consummated pursuant to the terms of the Offer), subject to any extension or subsequent offering period;  and (c) the expiration of the Interim Period (if the Offer is consummated pursuant to the terms of the Offer), in any case, unless sooner terminated  by unanimous written consent of the Participating Sponsors; provided, however, that any liability for failure to comply with this Agreement shall  survive any such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Section hereof (other than Sections 1 through 6 (inclusive) hereof) shall  survive indefinitely following the termination of this Agreement.     12. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified, and the provisions hereof may be waived, only by an agreement in writing  signed by each of the Sponsors.\n\n\n\nTender Offer Statement on Schedule TO - July 16, 2012 Exhibit (d)(i)  Sponsorship Agreement - July 16, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      13. Severability. In the event that any provision hereof would, under applicable law, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such  provision shall be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with applicable law.  The provisions hereof are severable, and any provision hereof being held invalid or unenforceable shall not invalidate, render unenforceable or  otherwise affect any other provision hereof.     14. Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall be enforceable by all available remedies at law or in equity  (including, without limitation, specific performance). Each Participating Sponsor shall be entitled, in their discretion, to either (a) specific performance of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters, together with any costs of enforcement incurred by such Participating Sponsor in seeking to enforce such remedy against any Defaulting Sponsor or (b) payment by the Defaulting Sponsor in an amount equal to the  out-of-pocket damages incurred by such Participating Sponsor. If any Participating Sponsor elects to enforce the remedy described in the  preceding sentence against any Defaulting Sponsor, such Participating Sponsor shall do so against all Defaulting Sponsors. No party shall be  entitled to recover lost profits or benefit of the bargain damages. If more than one Defaulting Sponsor is responsible for any damages, each such  Defaulting Sponsor's liability for such damages shall be determined pro rata (based on the Commitments of such Defaulting Sponsors).     15. Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Sponsor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other Sponsor  and any of its affiliates or any direct or indirect partner, member, shareholder, employee, director, officer or agent of such Sponsor or any of its  affiliates from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, judgments, awards, settlements, demands, offsets, and expenses  (including interest, penalties, court costs, arbitration costs and fees, witness fees and reasonable fees and expenses of outside attorneys,  investigators, expert witnesses, accountants and other professionals) arising out of or relating to any material breach or inaccuracy of the  representations, warranties or covenants of such Sponsor contained herein.     16. No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered  in connection herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that certain of the Sponsors may be partnerships or limited liability companies, by  acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, Purchaser and each Sponsor acknowledges and agrees that no Person other than each Party has any  obligation hereunder and no Party has any right of recovery under this Agreement or in any document or instrument delivered in connection  herewith, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation, against, and no personal liability shall attach  to, the former, current and future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general  or limited partners or assignees of the Sponsors or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general  or limited partner, member, manager, affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, \"Non-Recourse Parties\"), through Purchaser  or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Purchaser against any Non- Recourse Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable  law, or otherwise. Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall confer or give or shall be construed to confer or give to any party other than the  Parties any rights or remedies against any Person other than as expressly set forth herein.     17. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with, the laws of the  State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement  shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. The  parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New  York for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree  not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the  above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that  the venue of the action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any of the  above-named courts.\n\n\n\nTender Offer Statement on Schedule TO - July 16, 2012 Exhibit (d)(i)  Sponsorship Agreement - July 16, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      18. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE  LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT  OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.     19. Exercise of Rights and Remedies. No delay of or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any party as a  result of any breach or default by any other party under this Agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be construed as a  waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or of any similar breach or default occurring later, nor shall any such delay, omission or  waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default occurring before or after such waiver.     20. Other Agreements. This Agreement, together with the agreements referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes  all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and statements, both written and oral, among the parties or any of their affiliates with respect to the subject matter contained herein except for such other agreements as are referenced herein which shall continue in full force and effect in  accordance with their terms.     21. Cooperation. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) amend, supplement, or modify each Management-Ownership  Agreement, as necessary or appropriate, to be consistent with, and provide for each transaction and other matter contemplated by, this  Agreement; and (b) cooperate with each other Party, including, without limitation, as reasonably requested by any Party to jointly and mutually determine how best to structure and facilitate the Offer Matters and each agreement and transaction contemplated hereby and maximize value for  all concerned Parties, taking into account speed, timing, deal certainty, administrative convenience, and applicable tax, legal, and business  considerations and all other relevant issues.     22. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party or by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent  of each of the other parties. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section shall be null and void.     23. No Representations or Duties. Each Sponsor specifically understands and agrees that no other Sponsor has made or will make any  representation or warranty with respect to the terms, value or any other aspect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and explicitly disclaims any warranty, express or implied, with respect to such matters. In addition, each Sponsor specifically acknowledges, represents and warrants that it  is not relying on any other Sponsor (a) for its due diligence concerning, or evaluation of, the Company or its assets or businesses, (b) for its  decision with respect to making any investment contemplated hereby or (c) with respect to tax and other economic considerations involved in  such investment. In making any determination contemplated by this Agreement, each Sponsor may make such determination in its sole and  absolute discretion, taking into account only such Sponsor's own views, self-interest, objectives and concerns. No Sponsor shall have any  fiduciary or other duty to any other Sponsor or to Purchaser except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.     24. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate  counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same  agreement.

Our System includes (among other things): business processes, technologies, trade secrets, customer lists, knowledge, know-how, trade names, service marks, trademarks, logos, emblems, trade dress and other intellectual property; distinctive signage; standards, specifications and sources for services, products, supplies, appearance, operations and management control; safety standards; training and assistance; purchasing programs; and advertising, marketing, promotional and sales programs; all of which we may periodically change, discontinue, improve, modify and further develop.\n\nWe identify the System by means of our Proprietary Marks. Our proprietary marks include certain trade names (for example, the mark \"Goosehead Insurance\" and logo), service marks, trademarks, logos, emblems, and indicia of origin, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks that we may periodically specify in writing for use in connection with the System (all of these are referred to as our \"Proprietary Marks\"). We continue to develop, use, and control the use of our Proprietary Marks in order to identify for the public the source of services and products marketed under those marks and under the System, and to represent the System's high standards of quality, appearance, and service.\n\nWe are in the business of developing and awarding franchise rights to third party franchisees, such as you, to develop and operate businesses providing insurance services (\"Services\") to clients under the System and using the Proprietary Marks (\"Goosehead Businesses\").\n\nYou have asked to enter into the business of operating a Goosehead Business under our System and wish to obtain a franchise from us for that purpose, as well as to receive the training and other assistance we provide as described in this Agreement. You also understand and acknowledge the importance of our high standards of quality, appearance, and service and the necessity of operating the business franchised under this Agreement in conformity with our standards and specifications.\n\nYou will be in the business of operating a Goosehead Business, using the same brand and Proprietary Marks as other independent businesses that operate other Goosehead Businesses under the System. We will not operate your Goosehead Business for you, although we have (and will continue) to set standards for Goosehead Businesses that you will have chosen to adopt as yours by signing this Agreement and by your day-to-day management of your Goosehead Business to our brand standards.\n\nPage 1 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recognition of all of the details noted above, the parties have chosen to enter into this Agreement, taking into account all of the promises and commitments that they are each making to one another in this contract, and for other good and valuable consideration (the sufficiency and receipt of which they hereby acknowledge) and they agree as follows: 1 GRANT 1.1 Rights and Obligations. We grant you the right, and you accept the obligation, all under the terms (and subject to the conditions) of this Agreement: 1.1.1 To operate one Goosehead Business under the System (the \"Franchised Business\"); 1.1.2 To use the Proprietary Marks and the System, but only in connection with the Franchised Business (recognizing that we may periodically change or improve the Proprietary Marks and the System); and 1.1.3 To do all of those things only at the Approved Location (as defined in Section 1.2 below). 1.2 Approved Location. The street address of the location for the Franchised Business approved under this Agreement is specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement, and is referred to as the \"Approved Location.\" 1.2.1 When this Agreement is signed, if you have not yet obtained (and we have not yet approved in writing) a location for the Franchised Business, then you agree to enter into the site selection addendum (the \"Site Selection Addendum,\" attached as Exhibit G to this Agreement) at the same time as you sign this Agreement. You will then find a site which will become the Approved Location after we have given you our written approval for that site and you have obtained the right to occupy the premises, by lease, sublease, or acquisition of the property, all subject to our prior written approval and in accordance with the Site Selection Addendum. 1.2.2 We have the right to grant or withhold approval of the Approved Location under this Section 1.2. You understand, acknowledge, and agree that our review and approval of your proposed location, under this Section 1.2 or pursuant to the Site Selection Addendum, does not constitute our assurance, representation, or warranty of any kind that your Franchised Business at the Approved Location will be profitable or successful (as further described in Section 5 of the Site Selection Addendum). 1.2.3 You agree not to relocate the Franchised Business without our prior written consent. Any proposed relocation will be subject to our review of the proposed new site under our then-current standards for site selection, and we will also have the right to take into consideration any commitments we have given to other franchisees, licensees, landlords, and other parties relating to the proximity of a new Goosehead Business to their establishment. You must pay us a fee in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) at the time you request the relocation of the Franchised Business. 1.3 No Protected Territory. You expressly acknowledge and agree that this franchise is non-exclusive, and that this Agreement does not grant or imply any protected area or territory for the Franchised Business. Accordingly, we retain the right to conduct any business and sell\n\nPage 2 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nservices and products at any location, notwithstanding the proximity of that business activity to the Approved Location. We retain all rights, including but not limited to: (a) the right to use, and to license others to use, the System and the Proprietary Marks for the operation of Goosehead Businesses at any location; (b) the right to sell, and to license others to sell, products and services (including Services) that are also authorized for sale at Goosehead Businesses through other channels of distribution (including, but not limited to, through catalogs, mail order, toll free numbers, sales via Internet websites, and other forms of electronic commerce); (c) the right to acquire and operate businesses of any kind and to grant or franchise the right to others to operate other businesses of any kind, no matter where located; and (d) the right to use and license the use of the Proprietary Marks and other marks in connection with the operation of businesses at any location, which businesses and marks may be the same as, similar to, or different from the Franchised Business and the Proprietary Marks, on such terms and conditions as we deem advisable, and without granting you any rights therein. 1.4 Limits on Where You May Operate. 1.4.1 You may offer and sell Services only: (a) in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and the procedures set out in the Manual (defined below); and (b) to customers of the Franchised Business. 1.4.2 You agree not to offer or sell any services or products (including the Services and Products) through any means other than through the Franchised Business as provided in this Section 1.4; and therefore, for example, you agree not to offer or sell services or products from satellite locations, temporary locations, mobile vehicles or formats, carts or kiosks. Unless you become licensed in another state and receive prior written approval from us to offer insurance policies in that state, you may only provide and deliver Services to customers located within the State in which the Approved Location is situated. 2 TERM AND RENEWAL 2.1 Term. The term of this Agreement starts on the Effective Date and, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions, will expire ten (10) years from the Effective Date. 2.2 Renewal. You will have the right to renew your rights to operate the Franchise Business for two (2) additional successor terms of five (5) years, so long as you have satisfied all of the conditions specified in Sections 2.2.1 through 2.2.10 before each such renewal: 2.2.1 You agree to give us written notice of your choice to renew at least six (6) months before the end of the term of this Agreement (but not more than nine (9) months before the term expires). 2.2.2 You agree to remodel and refurbish the Franchised Business to comply with our then-current standards in effect for new Goosehead Businesses (as well as the provisions of Sections 8.9 and 8.10 below). 2.2.3 At the time of renewal, you must be in material compliance with the provisions of this Agreement (including any amendment to this Agreement), any successor to this Agreement, and/or any other contract between you (and your affiliates) and us (and our affiliates), and in our reasonable judgment, you must have been in material compliance during the term of this Agreement, even if we did not issue a notice of\n\nPage 3 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault or exercise our right to terminate this Agreement if you did not meet your obligations. 2.2.4 You must have timely met all of your financial obligations to us, our affiliates, the Brand Fund, and/or the Regional Fund, as well as your vendors, throughout the term of this Agreement (even if we did not issue a notice of default or exercise our right to terminate this Agreement if you did not meet your obligations). 2.2.5 You must sign our then-current form of franchise agreement, which will supersede this Agreement in all respects (except with respect to the renewal provisions of the new franchise agreement, which will not supersede this Section 2), and which you acknowledge and agree may contain terms, conditions, obligations, rights, and other provisions that are substantially and materially different from those spelled out in this Agreement (including, for example, a higher percentage royalty fee and marketing contribution). If you are an entity, then your direct and indirect owners must also sign and deliver to us a personal guarantee of your obligations under the renewal form of franchise agreement. (In this Agreement, the term \"entity\" includes a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, and a limited liability partnership.) 2.2.6 You agree to sign and deliver to us a release, in a form that we will provide (which will be a mutual release with limited exclusions), which will release all claims against us and our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, members, managers, agents, and employees. If you are an entity, then your affiliates and your direct and indirect owners (and any other parties that we reasonably request) must also sign and deliver that release to us. 2.2.7 You and your personnel must meet our then-current qualification and training requirements. 2.2.8 You agree to present to us satisfactory evidence that you have the right to remain in possession of the Approved Location for the duration of the renewal term of this Agreement. 2.2.9 You must be current with respect to your financial and other obligations to your lessor, suppliers, and all other parties with whom you do business. 3 OUR DUTIES 3.1 Training. We will provide you with the training specified in Section 6 below. 3.2 Layout and Equipping of a Goosehead Business.  We have the right to provide our standards and specifications for the layout and design of a Goosehead Business, including specifications for the exterior and interior design and layout, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, and signs. We have the right to periodically modify the layout and specifications as we deem appropriate. We will also provide the site selection and lease review assistance called for under Section 5.3 below. 3.3 Opening and Additional Assistance. We will provide such on-site pre-opening and opening supervision and assistance that we think is advisable, and as may be described in the Manual. 3.4 Manual. We will lend to you one (1) copy of (or provide you with access to), during the term of this Agreement, our confidential operations manuals and other written instructions relating\n\nPage 4 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nto the operation of a Goosehead Business (the \"Manual\"), in the manner and as described in Section 10 below. 3.5 Marketing Materials. We have the right to approve or disapprove all marketing and promotional materials that you propose to use, pursuant to Section 13 below. 3.6 Brand Fund. We will administer the Brand Fund (as defined in Section 13 below) in the manner set forth in Section 13 below. 3.7 Inspection Before Opening. We may evaluate the Franchised Business before it first opens for business. You agree to not open the Franchised Business or otherwise start operations until you or your Manager (defined below) have successfully completed training and you have received our prior written approval. 3.8 Periodic Assistance. We will provide you periodic assistance in the marketing, management, and operation of the Franchised Business at the times and in the manner that we determine. We may periodically offer you the services of certain of our representatives, such as a representative from agency support, and these representatives may periodically visit your Franchised Business and offer advice regarding your operations. 3.9 Revenue Report. On the 25th day of each month, we will provide you with a detailed report of Commissions (as defined below) and Agency Fees (as defined below) received on your behalf for insurance policies written in the preceding calendar months. In order to provide you with this report, we must receive a commission detail report from the carrier by the 20th day of the month, for policies you wrote during the preceding month. The report will only include Commissions and Agency Fees related to policies properly recorded in our agency management system as prescribed in the Manual. 3.10 Call Center. We will maintain a call center, staffed by licensed insurance agents, for the purpose of providing centralized customer service for all businesses operating under the System and the Proprietary Marks. The call center's hours will be at least between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday (excluding holidays). You must comply with any rules and regulations adopted by us (in the Manual or otherwise) regarding the call center. 3.11 Services Performed. You acknowledge and agree that any of our designees, employees, agents, or independent contractors (such as an \"area developer\") may perform any duty or obligation imposed on us by the Agreement, as we may direct (if so, we will, nonetheless, remain responsible to you for the performance of these obligations). 3.12 Our Decision-Making. In fulfilling our obligations under this Agreement, and in conducting any activities or exercising our rights pursuant to this Agreement, we (and our affiliates) will always have the right: (a) to take into account, as we see fit, the effect on, and the interests of, other franchised and company-owned or affiliated businesses and systems; (b) to share market and product research, and other proprietary and non- proprietary business information, with other franchised businesses and systems in which we (or our affiliates) have an interest, and/or with our affiliates; (c) to test market various items in some or all parts of the System; (d) to introduce new proprietary items and non-proprietary items; and/or (e) to allocate resources and new developments between and among systems, and/or our affiliates, as we see fit. You understand and agree that all of our obligations under this Agreement are subject to this Section, and that nothing in this Section will in any way affect your obligations under this Agreement.\n\nPage 5 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n3.13 Confirmation of Performance. After we have performed our pre-opening obligations to you under this Agreement, we may ask that you execute and deliver to us a confirmation (the \"Confirmation of Performance\"), in a form we reasonably request, confirming that we have performed those obligations. If we ask you to provide us with such a certificate, you agree to execute and deliver the Confirmation of Performance to us within three (3) business days after our request. However, if you do not reasonably believe that we have performed all of our pre-opening obligations, you must, within that same three (3) day period, provide us with written notice specifically describing the obligations that we have not performed. Not later than three (3) business days after we complete all the obligations that you specified in that notice, you agree to execute and deliver the Confirmation of Performance to us. You agree to do so even if we performed such obligations after the time performance was due under this Agreement. The term \"pre-opening obligations\" means the obligations we have to you under this Agreement that must be performed before the date when your Franchised Business starts its operations. 4 FEES; SALES REPORTING 4.1 Initial Franchise Fee. You agree to pay us an initial franchise fee in the amount set out in the Declarations Page attached as Exhibit A (the \"Initial Franchise Fee\"). The Initial Franchise Fee is not refundable in consideration of administrative and other expenses that we incur in providing you with training, carrier appointments, and pre-opening assistance as part of the initial launch of the Franchised Business. At your election, the Initial Franchise Fee is due and payable to us in one of the following ways: 4.1.1 You may pay to us the Initial Franchise Fee, in full, on the day that you sign this Agreement; or 4.1.2 You may elect to pay to us a portion of the Initial Franchise Fee on the day that you sign this Agreement in the amount set out in the Declarations Page attached as Exhibit A, and to pay to us the remaining portion of the Initial Franchise Fee, with interest, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the promissory note attached to this Agreement as Exhibit I (the \"Promissory Note\"). You acknowledge and agree that any default under the terms of the Promissory Note, including a failure to make any payments to us under the Promissory Note, shall be a default under this Agreement. 4.2 Royalty Fee. We will receive all Commissions (defined below) from insurance carriers. We will receive all Premiums (defined below), Policy Fees (defined below) and Agency Fees on your behalf. If the event that any Premiums, Policy Fees, or Agency Fees are received directly by you, these funds must be forwarded to us within twenty four (24) hours of receipt. We will retain Agency Fees and will forward Premiums and Policy Fees to the insurance carriers. Beginning on the date you begin operations under this Agreement, which is agreed to be the date set out in the Declarations Page (the \"Commencement Date\"), we will remit to you Net Revenues on a monthly basis. As used in this Agreement: 4.2.1 the term \"Agency Fees\" will mean fees that are charged by you for issuing a new policy pursuant to the Manual. 4.2.2 the term \"Commission\" will mean the total fees paid in cash to us, by insurance carriers as a percentage of the Premiums generated by insurance policies sold by the Franchised Business, on all new and renewal policies. 4.2.3 the term \"Gross Revenues\" means the amount of Commissions and Agency Fees received in cash, net of reversals of Commissions for policy cancellations or policy\n\nPage 6 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges and net of Agency Fee refunds, for insurance services provided by the Franchised Business; Gross Revenues will not include any Premiums or Policy Fees collected by the Franchised Business on behalf of any insurance carrier. 4.2.4 The term \"Minimum Royalty\" means a minimum monthly Royalty Fee payment, beginning six (6) months after the Commencement Date, in the following amounts: Number of Months following the Commencement Date Amount of Monthly Minimum Royalty\n\nSix (6) to Eighteen (18) Six Hundred Dollars ($600) Nineteen (19) and for the remainder of the term of this Agreement One Thousand Dollars ($1,000)\n\n4.2.5 the term \"Month\" means a calendar month or such other four (4) to five (5) week period that we may designate (provided that there will not be more than 13 \"Months\" during any year); and 4.2.6 the term \"Net Revenues\" means Gross Revenues net of all amounts due to us under this Agreement, including, without limitation, Royalty Fees, Marketing Contributions (if applicable), Technology Fees, and payments due to us under the Promissory Note (if applicable). 4.2.7 the term \"Premiums\" will mean fees that are paid to the insurance carrier for insurance coverage. 4.2.8 the term \"Policy Fees\" will mean fees to be paid to the insurance carrier for the issuance of a policy. 4.2.9 the term \"Royalty Fee\" is charged in consideration of you and your Managers' and Producers' use of our business processes, ongoing carrier relationships, trade secrets, know-how, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, emblems, trade dress, intellectual property, and back office support functions. The Royalty Fee will be the following amounts: (a) the greater of (i) twenty percent (20%) of Gross Revenues on insurance policies in their initial term, or (ii) the Minimum Royalty (defined below); and (b) fifty percent (50%) of Gross Revenues on policies in their renewal terms and policies written for existing customers on the same risk profile within a one-year period of the cancellation of their existing policy (also known as \"re-writes\"). 4.2.10 The \"Technology Fee\" will be an amount necessary to reimburse us for our costs of providing Required Software (defined in Section 14 below) to you. The Technology Fee may vary during the term of this Agreement, and we have the right to adjust the amount of the Technology Fee to account for our increased or decreased costs, separate from the Index. 4.3 Monthly Accounting. Once a Month, the insurance carriers will send a commission report and Commissions earned by you, to us. On the 25th day of each Month, unless this Agreement has been terminated for any reason, we will pay to you the Net Revenues for all policies identified in a commission detail report that we receive from the insurance carrier. Please\n\nPage 7 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nnote that we expect each insurance carrier to submit commission detail reports on a Monthly basis for all policies written during the preceding Month by no later than the 20th day of the subsequent Month. But, if a carrier does not provide us with a commission detail report (and the applicable Commission) by the 20th day of the Month, or if a policy is not identified in the commission detail report we receive, you will not receive the Gross Revenues for those policies until the insurance carrier provides us with the appropriate report and/or Commissions. We may delay or withhold payment of Net Revenues — on a policy by policy basis — for any policy for which you fail to observe the risk management procedures we prescribe in the Manual, including that you obtain a signed application from the customer and provide all required documentation. If we review your accounting and client records (as described in Section 12 below) and find that you have not forwarded to us any Premiums, Policy Fees and/or Agency Fees that you collect, we may pay the appropriate Premiums and Policy Fees to the insurance carrier. You will be responsible for reimbursing us for those amounts and the applicable Agency Fees, in addition to paying a fee to us to cover our reasonable expenses in processing those payments and interest on those amounts, at the rate of two percent (2%) per Month, or if less, the maximum rate permitted by law. Entitlement to such interest will be in addition to any other remedies we may have. 4.3.1 You agree to deliver to us all of the reports, statements, and/or other information that is required under Section 12 below, at the time and in the format that we reasonably request. 4.3.2 You agree to establish an arrangement for electronic funds transfer to us, or electronic deposit to us of any payments required under this Agreement. Among other things, to implement this point, you agree to sign and return to us our current form of \"ACH—Authorization Agreement for Prearranged Payments (Direct Debits),\" a copy of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D (and any replacements for that form that we deem to be periodically needed to implement this Section 4.3.2), and you agree to; (a) comply with the payment and reporting procedures that we may specify in the Manual or otherwise in writing; and (b) maintain an adequate balance in your bank account at all times to pay by electronic means the charges that you owe under this Agreement. If we elect to use ACH withdrawal to sweep payment of fees, then you will not be required to submit a separate payment to us unless you do not maintain sufficient funds to pay the full amount due. 4.3.3 You acknowledge and agree that your obligations to make full and timely payment of Royalty Fees and Marketing Contributions (and all other sums due to us) are absolute, unconditional, fully-earned (by us), and due when you are open and in operation. 4.3.4 You agree that you will not, for any reason, delay or withhold the payment of any amount due to us under this Agreement; put into escrow any payment due to us; set-off payments due to us against any claims or alleged claims that you may allege against us, the Brand Fund, a Regional Fund, affiliates, suppliers, or others. We reserve the right to apply any monies received from you to any of your obligations as we determine and to withhold payment of any monies if this Agreement has been terminated for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to set-off as part of Net Revenues any amounts you owe to us. 4.3.5 You agree that if you do not provide us, as requested, with access to your computer system to obtain sales information or, if we require pursuant to Section 12.1.4 below or otherwise, printed and signed sales reports, then we will have the right to impute your sales for any period using (among other things) your sales figures from any\n\nPage 8 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth(s) that we choose (which may be those with your highest grossing sales), and that you agree to pay the royalties on that amount (whether by check or by our deduction of that amount from your direct debit account). 4.3.6 You agree that you will not, whether on grounds of alleged non-performance by us or others, withhold payment of any fee, including, without limitation, Royalty Fees or Marketing Contributions, nor withhold or delay submission of any reports due under this Agreement. 4.4 No Subordination. You agree: (a) not to subordinate to any other obligation your obligation to pay us the Royalty Fee and/or any other amount payable to us, whether under this Agreement or otherwise; and (b) that any such subordination commitment that you may give without our prior written consent will be null and void. 4.5 Late Payment. If we do not (or an applicable marketing fund does not) receive any payment due under this Agreement on or before the due date, then that amount will be deemed overdue. If any payment is overdue, then you agree to pay us, in addition to the overdue amount, interest on the overdue amount from the date it was due until paid, at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum (but not more than the maximum rate permitted by law, if any such maximum rate applies). Our entitlement to such interest will be in addition to any other remedies we may have. Any report that we do not receive on or before the due date will also be deemed overdue. 4.6 Other Funds Due.

We have the right to adjust, for inflation, all fixed-dollar amounts under this Agreement (except for the Initial Franchise Fee) once a year to reflect changes in the Index from the year in which you signed this Agreement.

This Section 7 addresses those items. 7.1 Products. You agree to buy all products, equipment, furniture, supplies, materials and other products used or offered for sale at the Franchised Business only from suppliers as to whom we have given you our prior written approval (and whom we have not subsequently disapproved). In this regard, the parties further agree: 7.1.1 In determining whether we will approve any particular supplier, we will consider various factors, including: (a) whether the supplier can demonstrate, to our continuing reasonable satisfaction, the ability to meet our then-current standards and specifications for such items; (b) whether the supplier has adequate quality controls and capacity to supply your needs promptly and reliably; (c) whether approval of the supplier would enable the System, in our sole opinion, to take advantage of marketplace efficiencies; and (d) whether the supplier will sign a confidentiality agreement and a license agreement in the form that we may require (which may include a royalty fee for the right to use our Proprietary Marks and any other proprietary rights, recipes, and/or formulae).\n\nPage 13 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 For the purpose of  th is Agreement,  the term \"supplier\"  includes, but is not l imited to, manufacturers, insurance carriers, distributors, resellers, and other vendors. 7.1.3 Your Franchised Business will offer for sale only such insurance products and Services that conform to our specifications and quality standards and only through insurance carriers that we make available to you through our appointment process (\"Approved Products and Services\"). 7.1.4 You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to appoint only one supplier for Approved Products and Services (which may be us or one of our affiliates). 7.1.5 You may be required to use and/or offer for sale any of the Approved Products and Services that we designate. 7.1.6 You must maintain at all times an inventory of Approved Products and Services related to the Franchised Business's concept sufficient in quantity, quality and variety to realize your Franchised Business's full potential. 7.1.7 With regard to insurance products offered by you, the insurance carriers will set the policy prices, and we will set the Agency Fees. 7.1.8 If you want to buy any products, services or any item from an unapproved supplier, then you must first submit a written request to us asking for our prior written approval.

In this event, we may limit the number of approved suppliers with whom you may deal, designate sources that you must use for some or all Products and other products and services, and/or refuse any of your requests if we believe that this action is in the best interests of the System or the network of Goosehead Businesses. We have the right to approve or disapprove of the suppliers who may be permitted to sell products to you. Any of our affiliates that sell products to you will do so at our direction.

You agree to provide to the accounting service provider complete and accurate information that we or the accounting service provider require, and agree that we will have full access to the data and information that you provide to the accounting service provider or through the designated program. Additionally, if you fail to comply with the accounting standards and requirements under this Agreement, we may require that you use an approved independent bookkeeper and/or independent accounting firm and/or services and programs. 12.1.4 Each Month, you agree to submit to us, in the form we specify and/or utilizing our Required Software, a report for the immediately preceding Month.

We have the right at all reasonable times to examine, copy, and/or personally review or audit (at our expense) all of your sales receipts, books, records, and sales and income tax returns in person or through electronic access (at our option). We will also have the right, at any time, to have an independent audit made of your books and records.

If we conduct an inspection because you did not timely provide sales reports to us, or if an inspection discloses that you understated your sales, in any report to us (and/or underpaid your royalties), by three percent (3%) or more, or if you did not maintain and/or provide us with access to your records, then you agree (in addition to paying us the overdue amount and interest) to reimburse us for any and all costs and expenses we incur in connection with the inspection (including travel, lodging and wages expenses, and reasonable accounting and legal costs). These remedies will be in addition to any other remedies we may have. We may exercise our rights under this Section 12 directly or by engaging outside professional advisors (for example, a CPA) to represent us. 12.5 Operational Inspections.

You further agree to pay us our then-current per diem fee for our representative(s) and to reimburse us for our reasonable travel expenses if additional inspections at the Franchised Business are required when a violation has occurred and you have not corrected the violation, or if you did not provide us with your records or access to your records upon reasonable request that is permitted under this Agreement. 13 MARKETING 13.1 Marketing Activities and Funds. For each Month during the term of this Agreement, you agree to contribute an amount up to two percent (2%) of Gross Revenues to be allocated in the manner described in Section 13.2 below (the \"Marketing Contribution\"). The Marketing Contribution is payable and/or allocated in the manner and at the times required under Section 4.3 above (and as otherwise provided in this Section 13). 13.2 Allocation and Collection. 13.2.1 We have the right to allocate your Marketing Contribution in the proportion that we designate among the following: 13.2.1.1 the Brand Fund; 13.2.1.2 local marketing, which we may allocate between: (a) any regional marketing fund established for your area (a \"Regional Fund\"), as provided in Section 13.4 below (but we are not required to establish a Regional Fund for your area); and (b) funds that you will spend on local marketing and promotion. 13.2.2 We have the right to periodically make changes to the allocation of the Marketing Contribution as specified in Section 13.2.1 among those funds and/or local marketing and promotion, by giving you written notice of the change, and those changes will take effect at the end of that month.\n\nPage 27 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 No part of the Marketing Contribution (whether deposited in Brand Fund or a Regional Fund or designated for local marketing and promotional expenditures) shall be subject to refund or repayment under any circumstances. 13.3 Brand Fund. We have the right (but not the obligation) to establish, maintain, and administer a System wide marketing and promotional fund (the \"Brand Fund\"). If we establish a Brand Fund, then the following provisions will apply to that Brand Fund: 13.3.1 We (or our designee) will have the right to direct all marketing programs, with sole discretion over the concepts, materials, and media used in such programs and the placement and allocation thereof. You agree and acknowledge that the Brand Fund is intended to maximize general public recognition, acceptance, and use of the System; and that we and our designee are not obligated, in administering the Brand Fund, to make expenditures for you that are equivalent or proportionate to your contribution, or to ensure that any particular franchisee benefits directly or pro rata from expenditures by the Brand Fund. 13.3.2 The Brand Fund, all contributions to that fund, and any of that fund's earnings, will be used exclusively to meet any and all costs of maintaining, administering, staffing, directing, conducting, preparing advertising, marketing, public relations and/or promotional programs and materials, and any other activities that we believe will enhance the image of the System (including, among other things, the costs of preparing and conducting marketing and media advertising campaigns on radio, television, cable, and other media; direct mail advertising; developing and implementing website, social networking/media, search optimization, and other electronic marketing strategies; marketing surveys and other public relations activities; employing marketing personnel (including salaries for personnel directly engaged in consumer-oriented marketing functions), advertising and/or public relations agencies to assist therein; purchasing and distributing promotional items, conducting and administering visual merchandising, point of sale, and other merchandising programs; engaging individuals as spokespersons and celebrity endorsers; purchasing creative content for local sales materials; reviewing locally-produced ads; preparing, purchasing and distributing door hangers, free-standing inserts, coupons, brochures, and trademarked apparel; market research; conducting sponsorships, sweepstakes and competitions; engaging mystery shoppers for Goosehead Businesses and their competitors; paying association dues (including the International Franchise Association), establishing third-party facilities for customizing local advertising; purchasing and installing signage; and providing promotional and other marketing materials and services to the Goosehead Businesses operated under the System). 13.3.3 You agree to make your Marketing Contribution to the Brand Fund in the manner specified in Section 4.3 above. The Brand Fund may also be used to make loans (at reasonable interest rates); and to provide rebates or reimbursements to franchisees for local expenditures on products, services, or improvements, approved in advance by us, which products, services, or improvements we deem, in our sole discretion, will promote general public awareness and favorable support for the System. All sums you pay to the Brand Fund will be maintained in an account separate from our other monies and will not be used to defray any of our expenses, except for such reasonable costs and overhead, if any, as we may incur in activities reasonably related to the direction and implementation of the Brand Fund and marketing programs for franchisees and the System. The Brand Fund and its earnings will not\n\nPage 28 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\notherwise inure to our benefit. We or our designee will maintain separate bookkeeping accounts for the Brand Fund. 13.3.4 The Brand Fund is not and will not be our asset. We will prepare and make available to you upon reasonable request an annual statement of the operations of the Brand Fund as shown on our books. 13.3.5 Although once established the Brand Fund is intended to be of perpetual duration, we maintain the right to terminate the Brand Fund. The Brand Fund will not be terminated, however, until all monies in the Brand Fund have been expended for marketing purposes. 13.4 Regional Fund. We have the right to designate any geographical area for purposes of establishing a Regional Fund. If a Regional Fund for the geographic area in which the Franchised Business is located has been established at the time you commence operations under this Agreement, you must immediately become a member of such Regional Fund. If a Regional Fund for the geographic area in which the Franchised Business is located is established during the term of this Agreement, you must become a member of such Regional Fund within thirty (30) days after the date on which the Regional Fund commences operation. In no event will you be required to join more than one Regional Fund. The following provisions will apply to each such Regional Fund: 13.4.1 Each Regional Fund will be organized and governed in a form and manner, and will commence operations on a date, all of which we must have approved in advance, in writing. 13.4.2 Each Regional Fund will be organized for the exclusive purpose of administering regional marketing programs and developing, subject to our approval, standardized promotional materials for use by the members in regional marketing. 13.4.3 No marketing, advertising or promotional plans or materials may be used by a Regional Fund or furnished to its members without our prior approval, pursuant to the procedures and terms as set forth in Section 13.9 below. 13.4.4 Once you become a member of a Regional Fund, you must contribute to a Regional Fund pursuant to the allocation that we specify, as described in Section 13.2 above, at the time required under Section 4.3 above, together with such statements or reports that we, or the Regional Fund (with our prior written approval) may require. We also have the right to require that you submit your Regional marketing contributions and reports directly to us for distribution to the Regional Brand Fund. 13.4.5 A majority of the Goosehead Business owners in the Regional Fund may vote to increase the amount of each Goosehead Business owner's contribution to the Regional Fund by up to an additional two percent (2%) of each Goosehead Business's Gross Revenues. Voting will be on the basis of one vote per Goosehead Business, and each Goosehead Business that we operate in the region, if any, will have the same voting rights as those owned by our franchisees. You must contribute to the Regional Fund in accordance with any such vote by the Regional Fund to increase each Goosehead Business's contribution as provided in this Section 13.4.5. 13.4.6 Although once established, each Regional Fund is intended to be of perpetual duration, we maintain the right to terminate any Regional Fund.

You must make Monthly expenditures on local marketing and promotion of the Franchised Business in such amounts as we may designate as part of the allocation of the Marketing Contribution specified in Section 13.2 above.

We may periodically make available to you for purchase marketing plans and promotional materials, including newspaper mats, coupons, merchandising materials, sales aids, point-of- purchase materials, special promotions, direct mail materials, community relations programs, and similar marketing and promotional materials for use in local marketing. 13.7 Standards. All of your local marketing and promotion must: (a) be in the media, and of the type and format, that we may approve; (b) be conducted in a dignified manner; and (c) conform to the standards and requirements that we may specify.

For all proposed advertising, marketing, and promotional plans, you (or the Regional Fund, where applicable) must submit to us samples of such plans and materials (by means described in Section 24 below), for our review and prior written approval. If you (or the Regional Fund) have not received our written approval within fourteen (14) days after we have received those proposed samples or materials, then we will be deemed to have disapproved them. You acknowledge and agree that any and all copyright in and to advertising, marketing materials, and promotional plans developed by or on behalf of you will be our sole property, and you agree to sign such documents (and, if necessary, require your employees and independent contractors to sign such documents) that we deem reasonably necessary to give effect to this provision. 13.9 Rebates. You acknowledge and agree that periodic rebates, giveaways and other promotions and programs will, if and when we approve and adopt them, be an integral part of the System. Accordingly, you agree to honor and participate (at your expense) in reasonable rebates, giveaways, marketing programs, and other promotions that we establish and/or that other franchisees sponsor, so long as they do not violate regulations and laws of appropriate governmental authorities. 13.10 Considerations as to Charitable Efforts. You acknowledge and agree that certain associations between you and/or the Franchised Business and/or the Proprietary Marks\n\nPage 30 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nand/or the System, on the one hand, and certain political, religious, cultural or other types of groups, organizations, causes, or activities, on the other, however well-intentioned and/or legal, may create an unwelcome, unfair, or unpopular association with, and/or an adverse effect on, our reputation and/or the good will associated with the Proprietary Marks.

If we intend to exercise this option, we will notify you (or your appropriate legal representative) within thirty (30) days of the date we learn of such death or mental incapacity. 16.6.3.2 For assets other than furniture, fixtures or equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, the purchase price will be an amount equal to one and one-half times the Commissions, net of Royalty Fees, received by the Franchised Business during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the closing of the purchase of the assets by us, but if we re-sell the assets purchased under this Section within six (6) months of our purchase, the purchase price will be calculated to be ninety percent (90%) of the price for which we re-sell the business (if more than the original purchase price). The purchase price will be reduced by any current and long-term liabilities of the Franchised Business assumed by us and any amounts due to us from you at the time of sale. The purchase price for\n\nPage 41 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nfurniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location (if we elect to purchase these assets) will be the fair market value as you and we agree. If we and you (or your appropriate legal representative) cannot agree on the fair market value of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, each party will select an independent appraiser who will each provide a written appraisal of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or rights under the lease for the Approved Location and we may elect to exercise the option granted hereunder by paying to you the average of the two appraisals. We will pay the purchase price to you in twelve (12) equal, monthly installments following the purchase, provided that you are in full compliance with the covenants contained in this Agreement. If, at any time during the twelve (12) months following our purchase of your assets, as described above, you breach any covenant contained in this Agreement (or any other agreement between you and us), our obligation to pay the monthly installments will immediately cease. 16.6.3.3 We may elect to exercise our option to purchase your interest in the Franchised Business by sending written notice of the election to you (or your appropriate legal representative). The election may exclude the purchase of the furniture, fixtures, equipment and rights under the lease for the Approved Location. The closing of the sale will occur within thirty (30) days after we exercise our option to purchase the Franchised Business or such later date as may be necessary to comply with applicable bulk sales or similar laws. At closing, we and you agree to sign and deliver all documents necessary to vest title in the assets purchased by us free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except any assumed by us and/or to effectuate assignment of the lease for the Approved Location. You (or your appropriate legal representative) must cooperate fully and use your best efforts to acquire the landlord's approval of the assignment of the lease for the Approved Location to us, if necessary. If the lease for the Approved Location cannot be assigned to us, you will agree to sublease the Approved Location to us on all the same terms and conditions as are contained in your lease and will cooperate fully and use your best efforts to acquire the landlord's approval of the sublease, if necessary. We reserve the right to assign our option to purchase the Franchised Business or designate a substitute purchaser of the Franchised Business. 16.7 Consent to Transfer. Our consent to a transfer that is the subject of this Section 16 will not constitute a waiver of any claims that we may have against the transferring party, nor will it be deemed a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement by the transferor or transferee. 16.8 No Transfers to a Non-Franchisee Party to Operate a Similar Business. You agree that neither you nor any Principal of yours will transfer or attempt to transfer any or all of your Franchised Business to a third party who will operate a similar business at the Approved Location but not under the System and the Proprietary Marks, and not under a franchise agreement with us. 16.9 Bankruptcy Issues. If you or any person holding any interest (direct or indirect) in you become a debtor in a proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar law in the U.S. or elsewhere, it is the parties' understanding and agreement that any transfer of you, your obligations, and/or rights under this Agreement, any material assets of yours, and/or\n\nPage 42 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nany indirect or direct interest in you will be subject to all of the terms of this Section 16, including without limitation the terms of Sections 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 above. 16.10 Securities Offers. All materials for an offering of stock, ownership, and/or partnership interests in you or any of your affiliates that are required by federal or state law must be submitted to us for review as described below before such materials are filed with any government agency. Any materials to be used in any exempt offering must be submitted to us for such review before their use. 16.10.1 You agree that: (a) no offering by you or any of your affiliates may imply (by use of the Proprietary Marks or otherwise) that we are participating in an underwriting, issuance, or offering of your securities or your affiliates; (b) our review of any offering will be limited solely to the relationship between you and us (and, if applicable, any of your affiliates and us); and (c) we will have the right, but not obligation, to require that the offering materials contain a written statement that we require concerning the limitations stated above. 16.10.2 You (and the offeror if you are not the offering party), your Principals, and all other participants in the offering must fully indemnify us and all of the Franchisor Parties (as defined in Section 21.5.2 below) in connection with the offering. 16.10.3 For each proposed offering, you agree to pay us a non-refundable fee of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) or such greater amount as is necessary to reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees) for reviewing the proposed offering. 16.10.4 You agree to give us written notice at least thirty (30) days before the date that any offering or other transaction described in this Section 16.11 commences. Any such offering will be subject to all of the other provisions of this Section 16, including without limitation the terms set forth in Sections 16.4, 16.5, 16.6; and further, without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any such offering will be subject to our approval as to the structure and voting control of the offeror (and you, if you are not the offeror) after the financing is completed. 16.10.5 You also agree that after your initial offering, described above, for the remainder of the term of the Agreement, you will submit to us for our review and prior written approval all additional securities documents (including periodic reports, such as quarterly, annual, and special reports) that you prepare and file (or use) in connection with any such offering. You agree to reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees) that we incur in connection with our review of those materials. 17 DEFAULT AND TERMINATION 17.1 Automatic. If any one or more of the following events take place, then you will be deemed to be in default under this Agreement, and all rights granted in this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice to you: (a) if you become insolvent (meaning, you are unable to pay your debts as they fall due in the usual course of business) or make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) if a bill in equity or other proceeding for the appointment of a receiver for you or another custodian for your business or assets is filed and consented to by you; (c) if a receiver or other custodian (permanent or temporary) of your assets or property, or any part thereof, is appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction; (d) if proceedings for a composition with creditors under any state or federal law is instituted by or against you;\n\nPage 43 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) if a final judgment remains unsatisfied or of record for thirty (30) days or longer (unless unappealed or a supersedeas bond is filed); (f) if you are dissolved; or if execution is levied against your business or property; (g) if suit to foreclose any lien or mortgage against the Franchised Business premises or equipment is instituted against you and not dismissed within thirty (30) days; and/or (h) if the real or personal property of your Franchised Business will be sold after levy thereupon by any sheriff, marshal, or constable. 17.2 With Notice. If any one or more of the following events occur, then you will be in default under this Agreement, and we will have the right to terminate this Agreement and all rights granted under this Agreement, without affording you any opportunity to cure the default, effective immediately upon the delivery of our written notice to you (in the manner provided in Section 24 below): 17.2.1 If you do not obtain an Approved Location for the Franchised Business within the time limits specified under the Site Selection Addendum, or if you do not construct and open the Franchised Business within the time limits specified in Sections 5.1 and 8.2 above, and within the requirements specified in Sections 5 and 8.2 above; 17.2.2 If you at any time cease to operate or otherwise abandon the Franchised Business for ten (10) consecutive business days (during which you are otherwise required to be open, and without our prior written consent to do so), or lose the right to possession of the premises, or otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business in the jurisdiction where the Franchised Business is located (however, if through no fault of yours, the premises are damaged or destroyed by an event such that you cannot complete repairs or reconstruction within ninety (90) days thereafter, then you will have thirty (30) days after such event in which to apply for our approval to relocate and/or reconstruct the premises, which approval we will not unreasonably withhold); 17.2.3 If you or any of your Principals or Managers are convicted of a felony, a crime involving moral turpitude, or any other crime or offense that we believe is reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the System, the Proprietary Marks, the goodwill associated therewith, or our interest therein; 17.2.4 If a threat or danger to public health or safety results from the construction, maintenance, or operation of the Franchised Business; 17.2.5 If you or any of your Principals purport to transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement or any interest to any third party in a manner that is contrary to the terms of Section 16 above; 17.2.6 If you fail to comply with the requirements of Section 19 below; 17.2.7 If, contrary to the terms of Sections 10 or 11 above, you disclose or divulge the contents of the Manual or other confidential information that we provide to you; 17.2.8 If an approved transfer of an interest in you is not completed within a reasonable time, as required by Sections 16.7 above; 17.2.9 If you knowingly maintain false books or records, or submit any false reports (including information provided as part of your application for this franchise) to us;\n\nPage 44 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.10 If you commit three (3) or more defaults under this Agreement in any fifty-two (52) week period, whether or not each such default has been cured after notice; 17.2.11 If, after receipt of notice from us, you continue to sell any products or services from the Franchised Business that are not Approved Products or Services; 17.2.12 If you engage in any conduct or practice that is fraudulent, unfair, unethical, or a deceptive practice, or if you allow any of your Producers to operate dishonestly or carelessly; 17.2.13 If you misuse or misappropriate login information for access to insurance carrier websites or databases 17.2.14 If an insurance carrier terminates your ongoing business relationship, for cause; 17.2.15 If you or your Manager fails to successfully complete any required training programs to our reasonable satisfaction; 17.2.16 If your Franchised Business uses or sells any Prohibited Products or Services; and/or 17.2.17 If you make any unauthorized or improper use of the Proprietary Marks, or if you or any of your Principals use the Proprietary Marks in a manner that we do not permit (whether under this Agreement and/or otherwise) or that is inconsistent with our direction, or if you or any of your Principals directly or indirectly contest the validity of our ownership of the Proprietary Marks, our right to use and to license others to use the Proprietary Marks, or seek to (or actually do) register any of our Proprietary Marks with any agency (public or private) for any purpose without our prior written consent to do so. 17.3 With Notice and Opportunity to Cure. 17.3.1 Except as otherwise provided above in Sections 17.1 and 17.2 above, if you are in default of your obligations under this Agreement or the Manual, then we may terminate this Agreement by giving you written notice of termination (in the manner provided under Section 24 below) stating the nature of the default at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of termination (or ten (10) days before the effective date of termination for (i) any failure to pay the Initial Franchise Fee or an installment thereof, or (ii) any failure to timely enter information into the agency management system as required by the Manual). You may, however, avoid termination by: (a) immediately initiating a remedy to cure such default; (b) curing the default to our satisfaction; and (c) promptly providing proof of the cure to us, all within the thirty (30) day period (or ten (10) day period, as applicable). If you do not cure any such default within the specified time (or such longer period as applicable law may require), then this Agreement will terminate without further notice to you effective immediately upon the expiration of the thirty (30) day period (or ten (10) day period, or such longer period as applicable law may require). 17.3.2 If you are in default under the terms of any other franchise agreement or other contract between you (and/or your affiliates) and us (and/or our affiliates), that will also constitute a default under Section 17.3.1 above.\n\nPage 45 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4 Bankruptcy. If, for any reason, this Agreement is not terminated pursuant to this Section 17, and the Agreement is assumed, or assignment of the same to any person or entity who has made a bona fide offer to accept an assignment of the Agreement is contemplated, pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then notice of such proposed assignment or assumption, setting forth: (a) the name and address of the proposed assignee; and (b) all of the terms and conditions of the proposed assignment and assumption; must be given to us within twenty (20) days after receipt of such proposed assignee's offer to accept assignment of the Agreement; and, in any event, within ten (10) days before the date application is made to a court of competent jurisdiction for authority and approval to enter into such assignment and assumption. We will then have the prior right and option, to be exercised by notice given at any time before the effective date of such proposed assignment and assumption, to accept an assignment of the Agreement to us upon the same terms and conditions, and for the same consideration, if any, as in the bona fide offer made by the proposed assignee, less any brokerage commissions that may be payable by you out of the consideration to be paid by such assignee for the assignment of the Agreement. 17.5 Our Rights Instead of Termination. If we are entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Sections 17.2 or 17.3 above, we will also have the right to take any lesser action instead of terminating this Agreement. 17.6 Reservation of Rights under Section 17.5. If any rights, options, or arrangements are terminated or modified in accordance with Section 17.5 above, such action will be without prejudice to our right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Sections 17.2 or 17.3 above, and/or to terminate any other rights, options or arrangements under this Agreement at any time thereafter for the same default or as a result of any additional defaults of the terms of this Agreement. 17.7 Damages. You agree that you will pay us all damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses), that we incur as a result of any default by you under this Agreement and any other agreement between the parties (and their respective affiliates) (in addition to other remedies that we may have). 18 OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION\n\nUpon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights granted under this Agreement to you will forthwith terminate, and all of the following will take effect: 18.1 Cease Operation. You agree to: (a) immediately and permanently stop operating the Franchised Business; and (b) never directly or indirectly represent to the public that you are a present or former franchisee of ours. 18.2 Stop Using Marks and Intellectual Property. You agree to immediately and permanently cease to use, in any manner whatsoever, all aspects of the System, including any confidential methods, procedures and techniques associated with the System, the mark \"Goosehead Insurance\" and any and all other Proprietary Marks, distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, and devices associated with the System, and any and all other intellectual property associated with the System. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree to stop making any further use of any and all signs, marketing materials, displays, stationery, forms, and any other articles that display the Proprietary Marks. 18.3 Cancel Assumed Names. You agree to take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name or equivalent registration which contains the mark \"Goosehead Insurance\"\n\nPage 46 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nand any and all other Proprietary Marks, and/or any other service mark or trademark of ours, and you will give us evidence that we deem satisfactory to provide that you have complied with this obligation within five (5) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement. 18.4 Premises. We will have the right (but not the obligation) to require you to assign to us any interest that you (and/or your affiliates) may have in the lease or sublease for the ground upon which the Franchised Business is operated and/or for the building in which the Franchised Business is operated. 18.4.1 If we do not elect or if we are unable to exercise any option we may have to acquire the lease or sublease for the premises of the Franchised Business, or otherwise acquire the right to occupy the premises, you will make such modifications or alterations to the premises operated under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the changing of the telephone number) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to distinguish the appearance of said premises from that of other Goosehead Businesses, and must make such specific additional changes thereto as we may reasonably request for that purpose. In addition, you will cease use of all telephone numbers and any domain names, websites, e-mail addresses, and any other print and online identifiers, whether or not authorized by us, that you have while operating the Franchised Business, and must promptly execute such documents or take such steps necessary to remove reference to the Franchised Business from all trade or business directories, including online directories, or at our request transfer same to us. 18.4.2 If you fail or refuse to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 18.4, then we (or our designee) will have the right to enter upon the premises of the Franchised Business, without being guilty of trespass or any other tort, for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at your cost, which expense you agree to pay upon demand. 18.5 Our Option to Buy Your Assets. Within thirty (30) days after expiration or non-renewal under this Agreement and/or default under your lease/sublease for the premises, we shall buy from you (and/or your affiliates) all assets of the Franchised Business. This includes all rights of yours in prospects and policyholders and all business records and information regarding those customers, prospects and policyholders, including the name and address of the applicant or policyholder and the date of expiration and policy limits of any insurance policy or renewal, rights to solicit the customers, prospects and policyholders for the sale of insurance products and renewal of policyholders' current policies, rights to new, renewal or other commissions and compensation from the insurance carriers or their agents, book of business, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. We may elect not to include the furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location in that purchase. We are not obligated to purchase the assets of the Franchised Business under any other circumstances, but we may offer to do so in our sole discretion. 18.5.1 For assets other than furniture, fixtures or equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, the purchase price will be an amount equal to one and one-half (1 1∕2) times the Commissions, net of Royalty Fees, received by the Franchised Business during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the closing of the purchase of the assets by us. The purchase price will be reduced by any current and long-term liabilities of the Franchised Business assumed by us and any amounts due to us from you at the time of sale. The purchase price for furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location (if we elect to purchase these assets) will be the fair market value as you and we agree. If\n\nPage 47 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nwe and you cannot agree on the fair market value of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, each party will select an independent appraiser who will each provide a written appraisal of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or rights under the lease for the Approved Location and we may elect to exercise the option granted hereunder by paying to you the average of the two appraisals. The total purchase price will be for the assets of the Franchised Business that we elect to purchase, which may not include the furniture, fixtures, equipment and rights under the lease for the Approved Location. We will pay the purchase price to you in twenty four (24) equal, monthly installments following the purchase, provided that you are in full compliance with the covenants contained in this Agreement. If, at any time during the twenty four (24) months following our purchase of your assets, as described above, you breach any covenant contained in this Agreement (or any other agreement between you and us), our obligation to pay the monthly installments will immediately cease. We have the right to offset amounts that you owe to us against any payment that we may be required to make pursuant to this Section 18.5. 18.5.2 The closing of the sale will occur within thirty (30) days after we exercise our option to purchase the Franchised Business or such later date as may be necessary to comply with applicable bulk sales or similar laws. At closing, we and you agree to sign and deliver all documents necessary to vest title in the assets purchased by us free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except any assumed by us. We reserve the right to assign our repurchase rights described above or designate a substitute purchaser of the Franchised Business. 18.6 No Use of the Marks in Other Businesses. You agree, if you continue to operate or subsequently begin to operate any other business, that you will not use any reproduction, counterfeit copy, and/or colorable imitation of the Proprietary Marks, either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception, or which is likely to dilute our rights in and to the Proprietary Marks. You further agree not to use, in any manner whatsoever, any designation of origin, description, trademark, service mark, or representation that suggests or implies a past or present association or connection with us, the System, the equipment, and/or the Proprietary Marks. 18.7 Pay All Sums Due. You agree to promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates (regardless whether those obligations arise under this Agreement or otherwise). In the event of termination for any of your defaults, those sums will include all damages, costs, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses), that we incur as a result of the default. 18.8 Pay Damages. You agree to pay us all damages, costs, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur as a result of your default under this Agreement and/or subsequent to the termination or expiration of this Agreement in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 18, which will be in addition to amounts due to us under Section 18.11 below. 18.9 Return Confidential Information. You agree to immediately return to us the Manual, the Program Materials, and all other manuals, records, and instructions containing confidential information (including, without limitation, any copies thereof, even if such copies were made in violation of this Agreement), all of which are acknowledged to be our property.\n\nPage 48 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n18.10 Right to Enter and Continue Operations. In order to preserve the goodwill of the System following termination, we (or our designee) will have the right to enter the Franchised Business (without liability to you, your Principals, or otherwise) for the purpose continuing the Franchised Business's operation and maintaining the goodwill of the business. 18.11 Lost Future Royalties. If we terminate this Agreement based on your default, or if you abandon or otherwise cease to operate the Franchised Business, in addition to all other amounts due to us under this Agreement, you agree to pay to us, as liquidated damages, an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your monthly Royalty Fees that are due under this Agreement for the twelve (12) months immediately before your abandonment or our delivery of the notice of default (or, if you have been operating for less than 12 months, the average of your monthly Royalty Fees for the number of months you have operated the Franchised Business); (b) multiplied by the lesser of 36 or the number of months remaining in the then-current term of this Agreement under Section 2. 18.12 Our Rights. You agree not to do anything that would potentially interfere with or impede the exercise of our rights under this Section 18. 18.13 Offsets. We have the right to offset amounts that you owe to us against any payment that we may be required to make under this Agreement. 19 COVENANTS 19.1 Full Time Efforts. You agree that during the term of this Agreement, except as we have otherwise approved in writing, you (or the Operating Principal or Manager) will devote full time, energy, and best efforts to the management and operation of the Franchised Business. 19.2 Understandings. 19.2.1 You acknowledge and agree that: (a) pursuant to this Agreement, you will have access to valuable trade secrets, specialized training and Confidential Information from us and our affiliates regarding the development, operation, management, purchasing, sales and marketing methods and techniques of the System; (b) the System and the opportunities, associations and experience we have established and that you will have access to under this Agreement are of substantial and material value; (c) in developing the System, we and our affiliates have made and continue to make substantial investments of time, technical and commercial research, and money; (d) we would be unable to adequately protect the System and its trade secrets and Confidential Information against unauthorized use or disclosure and would be unable to adequately encourage a free exchange of ideas and information among franchisees in our system if franchisees were permitted to hold interests in Competitive Businesses (as defined below); and (e) restrictions on your right to hold interests in, or perform services for, Competitive Businesses will not unreasonably or unnecessarily hinder your activities. 19.2.2 As used in this Section 19, the term \"Competitive Business\" is agreed to mean any property and/or casualty insurance distribution business. 19.3 Covenant Not to Compete or Engage in Injurious Conduct. Accordingly, you covenant and agree that, during the term of this Agreement and for a continuous period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and/or a transfer as contemplated in Section 16 above, you will not directly, indirectly, for yourself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any party, in any manner whatsoever, do any of the following:\n\nPage 49 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n19.3.1 Divert or attempt to divert any actual or potential business or customer of any Goosehead Business to any competitor or otherwise take any action injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Marks and the System. 19.3.2 Employ or seek to employ any person who is then employed by us or any other Goosehead Business franchisee or developer, or otherwise directly or indirectly induce such person to leave his or her employment. In addition to any other rights and remedies available to us under this Agreement, in the event of a violation of this Section, we will have the right to require you to pay to us (or such other Goosehead Business developer or franchisee, as the case may be) an amount equal to three times the annual salary of the person(s) involved in such violation, plus an amount equal to our costs and attorney's fees incurred in connection with such violation. 19.3.3 Own, maintain, develop, operate, engage in, franchise or license, make loans to, lease real or personal property to, be associated with, accept any compensation or remuneration from, and/or have any whatsoever interest in, or render services or give advice to, any Competitive Business. 19.4 Where Restrictions Apply. During the term of this Agreement, there is no geographical limitation on the restrictions set forth in Section 19.3 above. During the two-year period following the expiration, the non- renewal, or earlier termination of this Agreement, or a transfer as contemplated under Section 16 above, these restrictions will apply only within the city and county in which the Approved Location is situated. These restrictions will not apply to businesses that you operate that we (or our affiliates) have franchised to you pursuant to a valid franchise agreement. 19.5 Post-Term. You further covenant and agree that, for a continuous period of two (2) years after (1) the expiration of this Agreement, (2) the non-renewal of this Agreement, (3) the termination of this Agreement, and/or (4) a transfer as contemplated in Section 16 above: 19.5.1 you will not directly or indirectly, for yourself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity, sell, assign, lease, and/or transfer the Approved Location to any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity that you know, or have reason to know, intends to operate a Competitive Business at the Approved Location; and 19.5.2 you will not solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any actual or potential business or customer of the Franchised Business to any Competitive Business. 19.5.3 You agree that, by the terms of any conveyance, selling, assigning, leasing or transferring your interest in the Approved Location, you shall include these restrictive covenants as necessary to ensure that a Competitive Business that would violate this Section is not operated at the Approved Location for this two-year period, and you will take all steps necessary to ensure that these restrictive covenants become a matter of public record. 19.6 Periods of Non-Compliance. Any period of non-compliance with the requirements of this Section 19, whether such non-compliance takes place after termination, expiration, non-renewal, and/or a transfer, will not be credited toward satisfying the two-year obligation specified above. 19.7 Publicly-Held Entities. Section 19.3.3 above will not apply to your ownership of less than five percent (5%) beneficial interest in the outstanding equity securities of any publicly-held\n\nPage 50 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\ncorporation. As used in this Agreement, the term \"publicly-held corporation\" will be deemed to refer to a corporation which has securities that have been registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 19.8 Personal Covenants. You agree to require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in Sections 9.3, 11, 16, 18 above, and this Section 19 (as modified to apply to an individual), from your Managers, Producers and other managerial and/or executive staff, as well as your Principals. The covenants required by this section must be in the form provided in Exhibit F to this Agreement. If you do not obtain execution of the covenants required by this section and deliver to us those signed covenants, that failure will constitute a default under Section 17.2.6 above. 19.9 Construction. The parties agree that each of the foregoing covenants will be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. We have the right to reduce in writing the scope of any part of this Section 19 and, if we do so, you agree to comply with the obligations as we have reduced them. 19.10 Claims Not a Defense. You agree that the existence of any claims you may have against us, whether or not arising from this Agreement, will not constitute a defense to our enforcement of the covenants in this Section 19. You agree to pay all costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur in connection with the enforcement of this Section 19. 19.11 Covenant as to Anti-Terrorism Laws. You and the owners of your business (\"Owners\") agree to comply with and/or to assist us to the fullest extent possible in our efforts to comply with Anti-Terrorism Laws (as defined below). In connection with such compliance, you and the Owners certify, represent, and warrant that none of their respective property or interests are \"blocked\" under any of the Anti-Terrorism Laws and that neither you nor any of the Owners are in violation of any of the Anti-Terrorism Laws.

The parties acknowledge and agree that: 21.1.1 this Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship between them; 21.1.2 you are the only party that will be in day-to-day control of your franchised business, even though we will share the brand and Proprietary Marks as specified in this Agreement, and neither this Agreement nor any of the systems, guidance, computer programs, processes, or requirements under which you operate alter that basic fact; 21.1.3 nothing in this Agreement and nothing in our course of conduct is intended to make either party an agent, legal representative, subsidiary, joint venturer, partner, employee, or servant of the other for any purpose whatsoever; and 21.1.4 neither this Agreement nor our course of conduct is intended, nor may anything in this Agreement (nor our course of conduct) be construed, to state or imply that we are the employer of your employees and/or independent contractors, nor vice versa 21.2 Notice of Status.

It is understood and agreed that, except as may be necessary for you to provide Products or Services to customers using the Proprietary Marks, nothing in this Agreement authorizes you to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on our behalf, or to incur any debt or other obligation in our name; and that we will in no event assume liability for, or be deemed liable under this Agreement as a result of, any such action; nor will we be liable by reason of any act or omission in your conduct of the Franchised Business or for any claim or judgment arising therefrom against either party to this Agreement. 21.4 Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Franchisor Parties against any and all Damages arising directly or indirectly from any Asserted Claim as well as from your breach of this Agreement.

As used in Section 21.4 above, the parties agree that the following terms will have the following meanings: 21.5.1 \"Asserted Claim\" means any allegation, claim or complaint that is the result of, or in connection with, your exercise of your rights and/or carrying out of your obligations under this Agreement (including any claim associated with your operation of the Franchised Business or otherwise), or any default by you under this Agreement, notwithstanding any claim that any Franchisor Party was or may have been negligent. 21.5.2 \"Franchisor Parties\" means us, our shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. 21.5.3 \"Damages\" means all claims, demands, causes of action, suits, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, assessments, judgments, losses, and expenses (including without limitation expenses, costs and lawyers' fees incurred for any indemnified party's primary defense or for enforcement of its indemnification rights). 22 FORCE MAJEURE 22.1 Impact.

The inability of either party to obtain and/or remit funds will be considered within control of such party for the purpose of Section 22.1 above. If any such delay occurs, any applicable time period will be automatically extended for a period equal to the time lost; provided, however, that the party affected makes reasonable efforts to correct the reason for such delay and gives to the other party prompt notice of any such delay; and further provided, however, that you will remain obligated to promptly pay all fees owing and due to us under this Agreement, without any such delay or extension.\n\nPage 53 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n23 APPROVALS AND WAIVERS 23.1 Request for Approval.

If we accept late payments from you or any payments due, that will not be deemed to be our waiver of any earlier or later breach by you of any terms, provisions, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement. No course of dealings or course of conduct will be effective to amend the terms of this Agreement. 24 NOTICES\n\nAny and all notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and must be personally delivered, sent by certified U.S. mail, or by other means which affords the sender evidence of delivery, of rejected delivery, or attempted delivery to the respective parties at the addresses shown on the signature page of this Agreement, unless and until a different address has been designated by written notice to the other party. Any notice by a means that gives the sender evidence of delivery, rejected delivery, or delivery that is not possible because the recipient moved and left no forwarding address will be deemed to have been given at the date and time of receipt, rejected, and/or attempted delivery.

This Agreement takes effect when we accept and sign this document. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed exclusively under the laws of the State of Texas, which laws will prevail in the event of any conflict of law (without regard to, and without giving effect to, the application of Texas choice-of-law rules); provided, however, that if the covenants in Section 19 of this Agreement would not be enforced as written under\n\nPage 55 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas law, then the parties agree that those covenants will instead be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located. Nothing in this Section 27.1 is intended by the parties to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, implied covenant, unfair competition, fiduciary, and/or other doctrine of law of the State of Texas (or any other state) that would not otherwise apply without this Section 27.1. 27.2 Choice of Venue. Subject to Section 27.3 below, the parties agree that any action that you bring against us, in any court, whether federal or state, must be brought only within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business. Any action that we bring against you in any court, whether federal or state, may be brought within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business. 27.2.1 The parties agree that this Section 27.2 will not be construed as preventing either party from removing an action from state to federal court; provided, however, that venue will be as set forth above. 27.2.2 The parties hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision. 27.2.3 Any such action will be conducted on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action. 27.3 Mediation. Before any party may bring an action in court against the other, the parties agree that they must first meet to mediate the dispute (except as otherwise provided in Section 27.5 below). Any such mediation will be non-binding and will be conducted in accordance with the then-current rules for mediation of commercial disputes of JAMS, Inc. (formerly, \"Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\") at its location nearest to our then-current principal place of business. 27.4 Parties Rights Are Cumulative. No right or remedy conferred upon or reserved to us or you by this Agreement is intended to be, nor will be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy herein or by law or equity provided or permitted, but each will be cumulative of every other right or remedy. 27.5 Injunctions. Nothing contained in this Agreement will bar our right to obtain injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction against threatened conduct that will cause us loss or damages, under the usual equity rules, including the applicable rules for obtaining restraining orders and preliminary injunctions. 27.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIALS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER, WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER PARTIES IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING. 27.7 MUST BRING CLAIMS WITHIN ONE YEAR.

EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM OF ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER, AND AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM EACH SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY IT. 27.9 Payment of Legal Fees. You agree to pay us all damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur after the termination or expiration of the franchise granted under this Agreement in: (a) obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation Sections 9 and 17 above); and/or (b) successfully defending a claim from you that we misrepresented the terms of this Agreement, fraudulently induced you to sign this Agreement, that the provisions of this Agreement are not fair, were not properly entered into, and/or that the terms of this Agreement (as it may be amended by its terms) do not exclusively govern the parties' relationship. 28 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 28.1 Your Investigation of the Franchised Business Possibilities.

The parties agree as follows:\n\nAGREEMENT\n\n1. Time to Locate Site: Within ninety (90) days after the date of this Addendum, you agree to acquire or lease/sublease, at your own expense, commercial real estate that is properly zoned for the use of the business that you will conduct under the Franchise Agreement (the \"Franchised Business\") at a site that we will have approved in writing as provided below.\n\na. Such location must be within the following area: (the \"Site Selection Area\").\n\nb. The only reason that the Site Selection Area is described is for the purpose of selecting a site for the Franchised Business.\n\nc. For purposes of this Addendum, the term \"Search Period\" means ninety (90) days from the date of this Addendum, or the period from the date of this Addendum until we have approved of a location for your Franchised Business, whichever event first occurs.\n\nd. If you do not acquire or lease a site (that we have approved in writing) for the Franchised Business in accordance with this Addendum by not later than ninety (90) days after the date of this Addendum, that will constitute a default under Section 17.2 of the Franchise Agreement and also under this Addendum, and we will have the right to terminate the Franchise Agreement and this Addendum pursuant to the terms of Section 17.2 of the Franchise Agreement.\n\n2. Site Evaluation Services: We will provide you with our site selection guidelines, including our minimum standards for a location for the Franchised Business, and such site selection counseling and assistance as we may deem advisable. If we deem on-site evaluation to be necessary and appropriate, we will conduct up to two (2) on-site evaluations at our cost and expense. If we perform any additional on-site evaluations, you must reimburse us, as applicable, for all reasonable expenses that we incur in connection with such on-site evaluation, including, without limitation, the cost of travel, lodging and meals. We will not provide on site evaluation for any proposed site before we have received from you a completed site approval form for the site (prepared as set forth in Section 3 below).\n\n3. Site Selection Package Submission and Approval: You must submit to us, in the form that we specify: (a) a completed site approval form (in the form that we require); (b) such other information or materials that we may reasonably require; and (c) an option contract, letter of intent, or other evidence satisfactory to us that confirms your favorable prospects for obtaining the site. You acknowledge that time is of the essence. We will have thirty (30) days after receipt of all such information and materials from you to approve or disapprove the proposed site as the location for the Franchised Business. We have the right to approve or disapprove any such site to serve as the\n\nPage 74 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nApproved Location for the Franchised Business. If we do not approve a proposed site by giving you written notice within the 30-day period, then we will be deemed to have disapproved the site.\n\n4. Lease Responsibilities: After we have approved a site and before the expiration of the Search Period, you must execute a lease, which must be coterminous with the Franchise Agreement, or a binding agreement to purchase the site. Our approval of any lease is conditioned upon inclusion in the lease of the Lease Rider attached to the Franchise Agreement as Exhibit H. However, even if we examine the Lease, we are not responsible for review of the Lease for any terms other than those contained in the Lease Rider.\n\n5. Approved Location: After we have approved the location for the Franchised Business and you have leased or acquired that location, the location will constitute the Approved Location described in Section 1.2 of the Franchise Agreement. The Approved Location will be specified on Exhibit A to the Franchise Agreement, and will become a part the Franchise Agreement.\n\na. You Franchisee hereby acknowledge and agree that our approval of a site does not constitute an assurance, representation, or warranty of any kind, express or implied, as to the suitability of the site for the Franchised Business or for any other purpose. Our approval of the site indicates only that we believe the site complies with our minimum acceptable criteria solely for our own purposes as of the time of the evaluation. The parties each acknowledge that application of criteria that have been effective with respect to other sites and premises may not be predictive of potential for all sites and that, subsequent to our approval of a site, demographic and/or economic factors, such as competition from other similar businesses, included in or excluded from criteria that we used could change, thereby altering the potential of a site. Such factors are unpredictable and are beyond our control.\n\nb. We will not be responsible for the failure of a site (even if we have approved that site) to meet your expectations as to revenue or operational criteria.\n\nc. You acknowledge and agree that your acceptance of a franchise for the operation of the Franchised Business at the site is based on its own independent investigation of the suitability of the site.\n\n6.

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the same meaning as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.

This provision may not be enforceable under California law.\n\nThe Franchise Agreement requires Franchisee to sign a general release of claims upon renewal or transfer of the Franchise Agreement. California Corporations Code Section 31512 provides that any condition, stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring any franchise to waive compliance with any provision of that law or any rule or order thereunder is void. Section 31512 voids a waiver of Franchisee's rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code Section 31000-31516).

Confidentiality.   (a) Confidential Information. \"Confidential Information\" means all non-public information about the disclosing party's business or activities that is marked or designated by such party as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" at the time of disclosure or that reasonably would be understood to be confidential given the circumstances of disclosure.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party to the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority or otherwise as required by law, provided that such party will, as soon as reasonably practicable, provide the disclosing party with written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing\n\n  9\n\nSource: IDEANOMICS, INC., 8-K, 11/24/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The receiving party and its representatives will cooperate fully with the disclosing party to obtain any such protective order or other remedy. If the disclosing party elects not to seek, or is unsuccessful in obtaining, any such protective order or similar remedy and if the receiving party receives advice from reputable legal counsel confirming that the disclosure of Confidential Information is required pursuant to applicable law, then the receiving party may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent required; provided, however, that the receiving party will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Confidential Information is treated confidentially by each party to which it is disclosed.   15.

(a) Approvals and Notifications for SpinCo IP Assets. To the extent that the transfer or assignment of any SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of any SpinCo IP Liability requires Approvals or Notifications, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or make such Approvals or Notifications as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement or as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and SpinCo, neither Parent nor SpinCo shall be obligated to contribute capital or pay any consideration in any form (including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial accommodation) to any Person in order to obtain or make such Approvals or Notifications.   (b) Delayed SpinCo Transfers. If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or assignment to the SpinCo Group of any SpinCo IP Asset or assumption by the SpinCo Group of any SpinCo IP Liability would be a violation of applicable Law or require any Approvals or Notifications in connection with the Separation that has not been obtained or made by the Effective Time, then, unless the Parties shall otherwise mutually agree\n\n  -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  in writing, the transfer or assignment to the SpinCo Group of such SpinCo IP Assets or the assumption by the SpinCo Group of such SpinCo IP Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed or such Approvals or Notifications have been obtained or made.

In addition, the member of the Parent Group retaining such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability in the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the member of the SpinCo Group to whom such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset is to be transferred or assigned, or which will assume such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, in order to place such member of the SpinCo Group in a substantially similar position as if such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, including use, non- abandonment, avoidance from contribution to the public domain, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, and all costs and expenses related thereto, shall inure from and after the Effective Time to the SpinCo Group.   (d) Transfer of Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities. If and when the Approvals or Notifications, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer or assignment of any Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the deferral of assumption of any Delayed SpinCo IP Liability pursuant to  Section 2.3(b), are obtained or made, and, if and when any other legal or other impediments for the transfer or assignment of any Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of any Delayed SpinCo IP Liability have been removed, the transfer or assignment of the applicable Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of the applicable Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable Ancillary Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.   (e) Costs for Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities. Any member of the Parent Group retaining a Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or a Delayed SpinCo IP Liability due to the deferral of the transfer or assignment of such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the\n\n  -7-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  deferral of the assumption of such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced (or otherwise made available) by SpinCo or the member of the SpinCo Group entitled to the Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by SpinCo or the member of the SpinCo Group entitled to such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability.   2.4 Novation of SpinCo IP Liabilities.   (a) Each of Parent and SpinCo, at the request of the other, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, as soon as reasonably practicable, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate or assign all SpinCo IP Liabilities and obtain in writing the unconditional release of each member of the Parent Group that is a party to any such arrangements, so that, in any such case, the members of the SpinCo Group shall be solely responsible for such SpinCo IP Liabilities; provided, however, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, neither Parent nor SpinCo shall be obligated to contribute any capital or pay any consideration in any form (including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial accommodation) to any third Person from whom any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release is requested.   (b)  If Parent or SpinCo is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release as set forth in Section 2.4(a) and the applicable member of the Parent Group continues to be bound by such agreement, lease, license or other obligation or Liability (each, an \"Unreleased SpinCo IP Liability\"), SpinCo shall, to the extent not prohibited by Law, as indemnitor, guarantor, agent or subcontractor for such member of the Parent Group, as the case may be, (i) pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such member of the Parent Group that constitute Unreleased SpinCo IP Liabilities from and after the Effective Time and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such payment, performance or discharge prior to any demand for such payment, performance or discharge is permitted to be made by the obligee thereunder on any member of the Parent Group. If and when any such consent, substitution, approval, amendment or release shall be obtained or the Unreleased SpinCo IP Liabilities shall otherwise become assignable or able to be novated, Parent shall promptly assign, or cause to be assigned, and SpinCo or the applicable SpinCo Group member shall assume, such Unreleased SpinCo IP Liabilities without exchange of further consideration.   2.5 Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.   3.2 License Grant to SpinCo.

Any transfer by SpinCo or a member of its Group shall require the transferee to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the transferred Intellectual Property in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further transfer of rights by such party or any use of the transferred Intellectual Property outside the scope of the license granted to SpinCo herein. If SpinCo enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this  Section 3.2  in connection with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business, then Parent and members of the Parent Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.   3.3 Neither Party shall make a trade secret of the other Party public or otherwise destroy or impair the trade secret status of such trade secret without the express, advance, written consent of the other Party.

(i) The Party initiating or otherwise controlling any enforcement IP Action hereunder (the \"Enforcing Party\"), including the right to communicate any objection or other form of challenge to any Third Party, shall, as between the Parties, have the right to select counsel for any IP Action initiated by it or its designee pursuant to this Section 3.6. The Party that is not the Enforcing Party (the \"Non-Enforcing Party\") shall, to the extent it is a necessary party to the IP Action (or is otherwise reasonably requested by the enforcing Party), join the Enforcing Party (and/or, if applicable, its designee(s)) at the Enforcing Party's expense and agree to be represented by counsel for the Enforcing Party in any infringement or other IP Action commenced by the Enforcing Party (or its designee) and shall, upon request of the Enforcing Party, execute such documents and perform such other acts as may be reasonably required and requested by the Enforcing Party at the Enforcing Party's expense in connection with such enforcement IP Action;  provided, that the Non-Enforcing Party shall have the right to engage, at its cost and expense, independent counsel of its choice to advise such Non-Enforcing Party in connection with such assistance to the Enforcing Party.   (ii) The Non-Enforcing Party shall cooperate with, and provide reasonable assistance to, the Enforcing Party (and its designees) in connection with any IP Action brought by the Enforcing Party (or its designee) hereunder to the extent relating to the Licensed SpinCo IP, as may be reasonably requested by the Enforcing Party, including by providing access to relevant documents and other evidence (provided that the Parties shall enter into a joint defense agreement with respect to the common interest privilege protecting such communications in a form reasonably acceptable to the Parties) and making its employees available, subject to the other Party's reimbursement of any costs and expenses incurred by the Non-Enforcing Party in providing such assistance. The Enforcing Party shall keep the Non-Enforcing Party reasonably informed of any determinations or significant developments in any IP Action initiated by it pursuant to this Section 3.6 and, if the Non-Enforcing Party is SpinCo, then the Parent shall reasonably consult with the SpinCo and take into consideration input provided to Parent by SpinCo to the extent reasonable and provided in a timely manner.   (c) Allocation of Costs and Recoveries. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, (i) the costs and expenses relating to any enforcement IP Action commenced pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be borne by the Enforcing Party; and (ii) any settlement payments or\n\n  -11-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  damages or other monetary awards (\"Recoveries\") recovered in any IP Action by the Enforcing Party, itself or through its designee, pursuant to this Section 3.6, whether by judgment or settlement, shall be allocated in the following order: (A) to reimburse the Enforcing Party for any costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Enforcing Party and/or its designee(s) with respect to such IP Action, (B) to reimburse the Non-Enforcing Party for any costs and expenses incurred by such Party with respect to such IP Action to the extent the Non-Enforcing Party participated in an IP Action pursuant to this  Section 3.6 (and has not already been reimbursed by the Enforcing Party), including if it joins such IP Action (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the cost of any counsel employed by the Non-Enforcing Party), and (C) the remainder shall be allocated to the Enforcing Party.   (d) Settlement of Enforcement IP Action. The Enforcing Party shall not settle, or enter into a voluntary consent judgment with respect to, any enforcement IP Action under this Section 3.6 in a manner that would include any admissions of invalidity or unenforceability against the Non-Enforcing Party, or wrongdoing by the Non-Enforcing Party or any of its Group, or imposes any liability or payment or other obligation on the Non-Enforcing Party or any of its Group, without the Non-Enforcing Party's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and in any event, without notifying the Non-Enforcing Party of any such proposed settlement or voluntary consent judgment. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, as between the Parties, the Enforcing Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle, or enter into a voluntary consent judgment with respect to, any enforcement IP Action under this Section 3.6. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not settle or enter into a voluntary consent judgment or enter into any other agreement that shall in any way impair the rights of SpinCo with respect to its Intellectual Property outside the Parent Field without SpinCo's consent, which may be withheld in its sole option.   3.7 Bankruptcy.

Neither Parent nor SpinCo shall make, and shall not permit any member of the Parent Group or SpinCo Group, as the case may be, to make, any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against the other Party or any other member of the Parent Group or SpinCo Group, as the case may be, or any other Person released pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or Section 4.1(b), with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or Section 4.1(b).

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY   5.1 Agreement for Transfer and Exchange of Information.   (a) Each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its Group, acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to Information that it will own as a result of the Separation, each is entitled to physical possession of Information that exists in tangible and intangible form, including Software, Technology, or electronic data that may exist on hard-drives, or other electronic storage means (\"Tangible/Intangible Information\"). Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party agrees that prior to the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time (\"Delivery Date\"), it will deliver possession of any Tangible/Intangible Information of the other Party that is in its possession or control to the other Party, without retaining any copies.   (i) To the extent that any Tangible/Intangible Information of SpinCo is in the possession of Parent, is comingled, and separation is not commercially reasonable, Parent will make such Tangible/Intangible Information available to SpinCo to separate at its own expense. If SpinCo chooses to separate such Tangible/Intangible Information, then Parent will deliver possession to SpinCo of any such separated Tangible/Intangible Information within one (1) month after such separation, without retaining any copies.   (ii) To the extent that any Tangible/Intangible Information of Parent is in the possession of SpinCo, is comingled, and separation is not commercially reasonable, SpinCo shall, at its option, (x) separate such comingled Tangible/Intangible Information at its own expense and deliver possession to Parent of any such separated Tangible/Intangible Information by the Delivery Date, without retaining any copies or (y) deliver possession of all of such comingled Tangible/Intangible Information to Parent by the Delivery Date, without retaining any copies.   (iii) To the extent Parent is in possession of any comingled Tangible/Intangible Information, that is not separated by SpinCo pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(i), then Parent shall be entitled to maintain possession of such Tangible/Intangible Information, but (A) shall provide reasonable access to SpinCo upon SpinCo's request, including the opportunity to make extracts or copies, and (B) Parent shall not use or otherwise access that portion of the\n\n  -15-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  comingled Tangible/Intangible Information that is the property of SpinCo, and shall retain such Tangible/Intangible Information in confidence as set forth in the Section 6.9 of the Separation Agreement. To the extent practical, SpinCo shall be entitled to redact or obscure any of SpinCo's Tangible/Intangible Information that is so retained by Parent.   (b) Subject to the applicable confidentiality obligations of the Separation Agreement, each of Parent and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its Group, agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or make available, or cause to be provided or made available, to the other Party and the members of such other Party's Group, at any time before, on or after the Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any Information (or a copy thereof) in the possession or under the control of such Party or its Group which the requesting Party or its Group requests, in good faith in order to evaluate or use such Information for commercial purposes within the Parent Field or SpinCo Field, as appropriate, to the extent that (i) such Information relates to any SpinCo IP Asset or SpinCo IP Liability, if SpinCo is the requesting Party; (ii) such Information is necessary for Parent or any member of Parent Group to exercise its rights under the license granted in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, if Parent is the requesting Party, (iii) such Information is required by the requesting Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement; or (iv) such Information is required by the requesting Party to comply with any obligation imposed by any Governmental Authority; provided, however, that, for any of the foregoing (i) - (iv), in the event that the Party to whom the request has been made determines that any such provision of Information could be detrimental to the Party providing the Information, violate any Law or agreement, or waive any privilege available under applicable Law, including any attorney-client privilege, then the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit compliance with such obligations to the extent and in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence. The Party providing Information pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) shall only be obligated to provide such Information in the form, condition and format in which it then exists, and in no event shall such Party be required to perform any improvement, modification, conversion, updating or reformatting of any such Information, and nothing in this Section 5.1 shall expand the obligations of a Party under Section 5.4.   5.2 Ownership of Information. The provision of any Information pursuant to Section 5.1 shall not affect the ownership of such Information (which shall be determined solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements), or constitute a grant of rights in or to any such Information (such grant of rights, to the extent they exist, are expressly addressed elsewhere in this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall be required to provide to the other Party any updates, improvements, or additions to any Intellectual Property that it owns after the Effective Time.   5.3 Compensation for Providing Information. The Party requesting Information pursuant to Section 5.1(b) above agrees to reimburse the other Party for the reasonable costs, if any, of creating, gathering, copying, transporting and otherwise complying with the request with respect to such Information (including any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in any review of Information for purposes of protecting the Privileged Information of the providing Party or in connection with the restoration of backup media for purposes of providing the requested Information). Except as may be otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the Separation Agreement,\n\n  -16-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  any other Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties, such costs shall be computed in accordance with the providing Party's standard methodology and procedures.   5.4 Other Rights and Obligations. The rights and obligations of the Parties under Section 6.4 (Record Retention), Section 6.5 (Limitation of Liability), Section 6.6 (Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information), Section 6.7 (Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation), Section 6.8 (Privileged Matters), Section 6.9 (Confidentiality), and Section 6.10 (Protective Arrangements) of the Separation Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Section 5 as if fully set forth herein. To the extent (a) Parent, or any member of the Parent Group, receives from SpinCo, or any member of the SpinCo Group, or (b) SpinCo, or any member of the SpinCo Group receives from Parent, or any member of the Parent Group, any Information that is trade secret under applicable law, the five (5) year confidentiality period of Section 6.9(a) of the Separation Agreement with respect to such Information shall be extended until such time as the received Information is no longer trade secret.   6. FURTHER ASSURANCES AND ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   6.1 Further Assurances.   (a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, prior to, on and after the Effective Time, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Effective Time, each Party hereto shall cooperate with the other Party, and without any further consideration, but at the expense of the requesting Party, to execute and deliver, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all Approvals or Notifications of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument (including any consents or Governmental Approvals), and to take all such other actions as such Party may reasonably be requested to take by the other Party from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the transfers of the SpinCo IP Assets and the assignment and assumption of the SpinCo IP Liabilities and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   (c) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent and SpinCo in their respective capacities as direct and indirect shareholders of the members of their Groups, shall each ratify any actions which are reasonably necessary or desirable to be taken by Parent, SpinCo or any of the members of their respective Groups, as the case may be, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   7. TERMINATION   7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, without the approval or consent of\n\n  -17-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  any other Person, including SpinCo. After the Effective Time, this Agreement may not be terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Parties.   7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, no Party (nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents) shall have any Liability or further obligation to the other Party by reason of this Agreement.   8. MISCELLANEOUS   8.1 Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Corporate Power.   (a) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party.   (b) This Agreement and the Separation Agreement and the Exhibits, Schedules and appendices hereto and thereto contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous agreements, negotiations, discussions, writings, understandings, commitments and conversations with respect to such subject matter, and there are no agreements or understandings between the Parties with respect to this Agreement.   (c) Parent represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the Parent Group, and SpinCo represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the SpinCo Group, as follows:   (i) each such Person has the requisite corporate or other power and authority and has taken all corporate or other action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and   (ii)  this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of it enforceable in accordance with the terms thereof.   (d)  Each Party acknowledges that it and each other Party may execute this Agreement by facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature, and that delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement (whether executed by manual, stamp or mechanical signature) by facsimile or by email in portable document format (PDF) shall be effective as delivery of such executed counterpart of this Agreement. Each Party expressly adopts and confirms each such facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature (regardless of whether delivered in person, by mail, by courier, by facsimile or by email in portable document format (PDF)) made in its respective name as if it were a manual signature delivered in person, agrees that it will not assert that any such signature or delivery is not adequate to bind such Party to the same extent as if it were signed manually and delivered in person and agrees that, at the reasonable request of the other Party at any time, it will as promptly as reasonably practicable cause this Agreement to be manually executed (any such execution to be as of the date of the initial date thereof) and delivered in person, by mail or by courier.\n\n  -18-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  8.2 Other Incorporated Miscellaneous Terms.

WHEREAS, Company desires from time to time to retain Contractor to perform certain management consulting services for Company; and WHEREAS, Contractor desires to perform such management consulting services for Company; NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. PURPOSE OF ENGAGEMENT. (a) Company agrees to retain Contractor to perform the consulting services for Company, on a task by task basis (the \"Services\"), and Contractor agrees to furnish the Services on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement, Company and Contractor will develop and agree upon statements of work defining the Services and work product to be provided by Contractor, Contractor's compensation, additional terms and conditions, if any, applicable to a particular engagement and such other details as the parties deem appropriate (each a \"Statement of Work\"). A Statement of Work may provide specifications for deliverables to be provided thereunder (the \"Specifications\"). Statements of Work that are from time to time agreed upon shall reference this Agreement, and shall be executed by the parties and attached hereto and shall form a part hereof. In all instances of a conflict, between the provisions of this Agreement and the specific provisions set forth in a Statement of Work, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. (b) Contractor shall provide sufficient qualified personnel to perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry standards. A Statement of Work may designate certain individuals as \"Key Personnel\" for an engagement, and the parties subsequently may agree in writing that additional individuals are Key Personnel for such engagement. If there are Key Personnel for an engagement, Contractor shall provide the Services through those personnel and such additional personnel of Contractor as Contractor may from time to time determine to be required for the performance of the Services. Company shall have the right to interview and approve such additional personnel at Company's request. If one or more Key Personnel terminate their employment with Contractor or otherwise become\n\nPage 2 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nunavailable to work on an engagement for reasons beyond Contractor's reasonable control, Contractor may provide the Services through other personnel with comparable training and experience. If Company becomes dissatisfied with any of Contractor's personnel providing the Services, Company may notify Contractor of the details of its dissatisfaction, and the parties shall cooperate to remedy the problem as soon as possible. If Company reasonably requests, Contractor shall reassign the individual who is the subject of Company's dissatisfaction and replace that person with other personnel in accordance with this Agreement. (c) Unless otherwise provided in a Statement of Work, Contractor shall provide the Services at Contractor's facility. Contractor shall provide computing equipment consistent with the Services to be provided under the Statement of Work. When services are provided at a Company facility, Company shall provide workspace and other facilities such as computer support consistent with the requirements of the Services to be provided under the Statement of Work. Contractor shall cause its personnel at Company's facility to comply with Company's (i) safety and security rules and other rules applicable to those working in the facility, and (ii) Company's policies concerning access to and security of any Company computer system to which Contractor may have access; provided, that Company has provided Contractor with copies of such rules and policies or has advised Contractor of the existence of such rules and policies. (d) Company may request changes that affect the scope or duration of the Services relating to any Statement of Work, including changes in the Specifications and changes in the deliverables to be delivered. Company acknowledges that any change in Specifications may result in changes to estimated fees and estimated timeline for creation of deliverables. Company also may request a change in the Schedule without changing the scope of the Services relating to the applicable Statement of Work. In either case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment in the applicable fees, Schedule and Specifications. Contractor shall continue work pursuant to the existing Statement of Work, and shall not be bound by any change requested by Company, until such change has been accepted in writing by Contractor. (e) The obligations of Company in connection with a particular engagement shall be set forth in the applicable Statement of Work. Company agrees to perform such obligations in accordance with, and subject to, such Statement of Work. Company acknowledges that when a Statement of Work provides that Company's personnel are to work with Contractor's personnel in connection with an engagement, Company's failure to assign Company personnel having skills commensurate with their role with respect to such engagement could adversely affect Contractor's ability to provide the Services.\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) To the extent Contractor provides any third party materials and products Contractor acknowledges that it shall be solely responsible for ensuring the functionality and specifications of such third party materials and products used in performing Services under this Agreement. 2. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall begin on the date hereof and shall continue until terminated by either party pursuant to Paragraph 6 hereof. 3. CONTRACTOR'S COMPENSATION. (a) During the term of this Agreement, Company agrees to compensate Contractor as set forth in each Statement of Work. Contractor will be compensated on a time and materials. In addition, Company shall reimburse Contractor its actual out-of-pocket expenses as reasonably incurred by Contractor in connection with its performance of the Services as negotiated in each Statement of Work. (b) Contractor shall bill Company as set forth in the relevant Statement of Work. Each invoice submitted by Contractor will provide supporting detail for the Services invoiced, including, to the extent applicable to a particular engagement, the dates of Services and hours worked at the applicable rate by Statement of Work. Invoices shall also include receipts or other supporting detail concerning related expenses within the billing cycle. Contractor reserves the right to change rates with 30 days notice to Company. (c) All fees, charges and other amounts payable to Contractor hereunder do not include any sales, use, excise, value added or other applicable taxes, tariffs or duties, payment of which shall be the sole responsibility of Company (excluding any applicable taxes based on Contractor's net income or taxes arising from the independent contractor relationship between Contractor and its personnel). In the event that such taxes, tariffs or duties are assessed against Contractor, Company shall reimburse Contractor for any such amounts paid by Contractor or provide Contractor with valid tax exemption certificates with respect thereto. 4. OWNERSHIP OF MATERIALS RELATED TO SERVICES; ACCEPTANCE. (a) The parties agree that all drawings, documents, designs, models, inventions, computer programs, computer systems, data, computer documentation and other tangible materials authored or prepared by Contractor for Company as the work product required by a Statement of Work (collectively, the \"Works\"), are the property of Company to the extent that such Works were created by Contractor for Company over a time period for which Company has been invoiced and said invoice has been paid. Contractor agrees to render, at Company's sole cost\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nand expense, all reasonably required assistance to Company to protect the rights herein above described, including executing other documents as requested by Company. (b) Company acknowledges that Contractor provides consulting and development services to other clients, and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to prevent Contractor from delivering on such business. In particular, Company agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein: (i) as part of Contractor's provision of the Services hereunder, Contractor may utilize its own proprietary works of authorship, that have not been created specifically for Company, including without limitation software, methodologies, tools, specifications, drawings, sketches, models, samples, records and documentation, as well as copyrights, trademarks, servicemarks, ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, knowledge or data, which have been originated, developed or purchased by Contractor or by third parties under contract to Contractor, and, (ii) Contractor's Information and Contractor's administrative communications and records relating to the Services shall not be deemed to be Works and are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Contractor and Company shall not resell or make use of said property in any other manner other than in connection with the software Company receives under this Agreement. (c) To the extent that Contractor incorporates any of Contractor's Information into the Works, Contractor hereby grants to Company a royalty-free, non- exclusive perpetual license (including the right to grant a sublicense) to use, copy, modify, create, derivative version, publicly perform and publicly display such Contractor's Information in connection with Company's business operations. (d) Consultant agrees that after Company pays Contractor in full, or after the termination of this agreement, Company may make any changes or additions to the software Consultant created for Company under this Agreement, which Company in Company's discretion may consider necessary, and Company may engage others to make any such changes or additions, without further payments to Consultant. 5. CONTRACTOR'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. (a) Contractor represents and warrants to Company that Contractor's performance of the Services called for by this Agreement, to its knowledge, does not and shall not violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation;\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Contractor represents and warrants to Company that Contractor has full authority and sufficient rights, except for rights respecting programs, data and materials provided by Company or identified by Contractor as furnished to Company by third-party vendors, to grant and convey the rights granted to Company under Paragraph 4 hereof; (c) Contractor represents and warrants that the Works provided hereunder, including any Contractor Information and any third party products do not infringe any trade secret, trademark, copyright, patent or other proprietary right of any other third party.

Specifically, Contractor agrees that it will not offer or pay any bribes to any person (including, in particular, to any government official) in connection with any aspect of the performance of services under this agreement. Contractor also covenants that at all times during the term of this agreement that it will maintain internal policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that Contractor's employees and representatives will not offer to pay or pay bribes (or offer or provide improper gifts or entertainment) to any person in connection with Contractor's performance under this agreement. Contractor also covenants that it will provide suitable training to its employees and representatives during the term of this agreement about Contractor's anti-corruption policies and procedures. Contractor represents and warrants to Company that Contractor has not offered or paid any bribes (or offered or provided any improper gifts and entertainment) to secure business under this agreement or otherwise in connection with the performance of its obligations under this agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if Contractor offers or pays a bribe or provides improper gifts or entertainment to any government official or to any other person in connection with the performance of Contractor's obligations under this agreement, Company shall be entitled to elect to terminate this agreement effective immediately upon providing to Contractor written notice of such termination, in which case Company shall have no obligation to pay any fees or other consideration to Contractor under this agreement or otherwise.
